<p>The report that I am having trouble with has the following structure shown in code snippet #1</p>

<p>The data for it comes from a SQL query that works perfectly, so it's only the layout that is bugging me.</p>

<p>In the detail I have a bunch of textfields that visualise some hierarchy and another textfield that can contain relatively large amount of text. I've packed each of them in a frame, both of them building up another frame.</p>

<p>Beneath them I have another frame which can contain 0,1 or 2 images (ideally). I end up with a report containing pages like the one in attachment 1.</p>

<p>My goal is to have report pages where there is no space between the above frame and the image frame - like the one in attachment 2, and of course with the text within the upper frame. At the moment this is only possible if I get rid of the lengthy text.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the problem lies in the definition of the field for the lengthy text. As I don't know how long the string would be, i define it with a height of 13 (code snippet #2 ), that is one line only. Because of the stretching properties of the fields it accommodates accordingly, but by doing so it pushes the images down by variable number of lines. So, is there any way to avoid that ""pushing"", which ruins the design.</p>

804356,Extra Process file locks,"<p>I have a .NET system where I need to allow files to be locked and unlocked across process boundaries. The model I plan to use is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User generate a lock token</li>
<li>Uses Locks a file with token and refreshes token</li>
<li>repeat at #2 as needed</li>
<li>Uses unlocks all files by releasing token</li>
<li>If uses fails to refresh token in some time-frame, #4 happens automatically</li>
</ol>

<p>Each step can be done from a different process.</p>

<p>The question is two fold: <em>is this a reasonable model and are there any readily available tools for implementing it?</em> If this can't be directly done in the OS, I'm thinking of some sort of advisory locking with <code>.file</code>s or the like.</p>

<p>Imagine objects with many more properties, used in many more ""subclasses"" and you start to see the tedium. A code-gernation tool would actually be just <em>fine</em>...</p>

<p>So, LinFu....
The mixin example below is fine but I'd want to have an actual Person <em>class</em> (as above) - what's the LinFu-esque way of doing that? Or have I missed the whole point? </p>

bool isPerson = dynamic.LooksLike&lt;IPerson&gt;();

dynamic.MixWith(new HasAge(18));
dynamic.MixWith(new Nameable(""Me""));

// Now that it’s implemented, this
// will be true
isPerson = dynamic.LooksLike&lt;IPerson&gt;();

if (isPerson)

812998,Connection Problems With Mirrored Database,"<p>The setup is as follows: </p>

<p>A C++ client connects via OLEDB/SQL Native Client to a SQL Server 2005 database located on another machine.  The server is setup with mirroring (automatic failover) with a synchronized server located on yet another server and a witness server on another server.  </p>

<p>Occassionally (once every couple of days), our application seizes up in that it appears to attempt to establish a database connection to the database and rather than simply failing and OLEDB throwing a database connection failure it just gets ""stuck"" (we have a timeout for the connection but it's never timing out).  24 to 36 <em>hours</em> later we'll get an error:</p>

<pre><code>TCP Provider: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.

<p>And things will continue you on with lots of these errors and our app will eventually need to be restarted.  We can't really figure out what condition could be causing this behavior and what we can do about it?  </p>

818926,Problem with local variable inside an event in JavaScript,"<p>I am developing a page which has a resizable and draggable div, and I have attached <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event handlers to this div.</p>
<p>The problem is with the <code>mousemove</code> event handler. I have to get the current width, height, top and left of the div. For that I am using functions to return the specific values and I have to use these values in different conditions inside the main function.</p>
<p>If I try to assign local variables with these values and use these variables in the preceding code then the script becomes slow. Means there's a delay in the resizing and dragging.</p>
<p>But if I call the functions each time instead of using these variables in the condition then there's no delay.</p>

841732,JTextArea font change is slow,"<p>I have a curious problem with the JTextArea control:</p>

<p>When I bring up my <code>JTextArea</code> everything is fine and whatever I type shows up without delay. However as soon as I send a <code>FontSizeAction</code> to my <code>EditorKit</code> (RTFEditorKit in this case, but it does not seem to matter which I use), a delay, from 1 - several seconds, happens. </p>

<p>Interestingly the delay only happens after you type something, that is a font change followed by doing nothing and then typing, makes no difference from just typing immediately. The delay is the same. I can see that right after typing the first letter after a FontSizeAction, allocation increases with a couple of megs. </p>

<p>I have used a profiler on the application and there's nothing in my own app that seems to be the problem. </p>

<p><strong>My code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>private void updateFont(MainModelManager model) {
    (new RTFEditorKit.FontSizeAction(""font-size-"" + model.getFontSize(),
                                     model.getFontSize())).actionPerformed(
        new ActionEvent(this, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, null) );

    (new RTFEditorKit.FontFamilyAction(""font-family-"" + model.getFontFamily(), model.getFontFamily())).actionPerformed(
            new ActionEvent(this, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, model.getFontFamily()) );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is part of the declaration of the main model container:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainModelManager extends Observable {
    DefaultStyledDocument doc;
    int fontSize = 12;
    String fontType = ""Helvetica"";
    StyleContext sc; 
    Caret editorCaret;
    boolean editorFrameIsResizable;  
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<p>I think I have narrowed to problem down to the FontFamilyAction because, if I comment it out the delay disappears and I can still change the font size without a problem. Maybe this has something to do with loading fonts?</p>",,0,4,,2009. 5. 8 오후 8:51:05,,2020. 4. 27 오전 10:48:22,2020. 4. 27 오전 10:48:22,Philip Loventoft,1135954,Philip Loventoft,,,1,1,java|jtextarea,776

<p>This is probably the 10th version of this, as I've tried various things to get the if/else if/else structure to work.</p>

<p>Basically, my Main gets a StatementList of Statements, sIf being one of them.  sIf tries to find either the multi-line or the single line if statement followed by an sElseIf which is optional(you don't have to have an else).</p>

<p>I think the problem is the regex compiler may be seeing the else if as an sElse followed by an sIf statement, instead of an sElseIf statement.

895577,How to manage various ASP.NET Web Site project references and autoupdate,"<p>I have a Visual Studio 2008 Web Site project in a solution with a number of other assembly projects.</p>

<p>The Web Site project has 4 types of references: Project, bin, COM Interop, and text files.</p>

<p>The Project references autoupdate perfectly.</p>

<p>The bin references for managed DLLs autoupdate with .refresh files, which work well and can be checked into Visual SourceSafe.</p>

<p>My question is about how to manage the other two types - COM Interop and text files.</p>

<p>I have an OCX that, when added as a reference, creates an interop DLL without a .refresh file. Checking the interop DLL into VSS isn't desirable, as you then have to check it out whenever you build. Moving the interop DLL to another location to reference directly doesn't work as I need to strong name my assemblies, which requires the original OCX in this case. The interop reference doesn't even show up on the Property Pages > References page. </p>

<p><strong>How do I get it to properly autoupdate? How can I fashion an appropriate .refresh file?</strong></p>

<p>I have plain text files that contain licenses for the other managed DLL references. I created .refresh files that seem to work for both VS2008 and VSS, but weren't created for me automatically. </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm on 1.1-beta3 and have implemented a file upload/attachment system as outlined herer: <code>thegioraproject.com/2008/03/26/image-attachments-in-grails-using-imagemagick/</code></p>

<p>I've got a 'broker' object which has a 'logo' (defined as an Image domain).  The Image and Attachment (parent class) are done as defined in the above URL.</p>

<p>In the brokerController, I've got code like this:</p>

<pre><code>    def file = new Image()
    def f = params.logo
    if(f.size&gt;0) {
        file.setFile(f)
        file?.save(flush:true)
        brokerUserInstance.logo?.delete()
        brokerUserInstance.logo = file
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The 'logo' is the name of the uploaded file from the form.  After this code there's more standard grails CRUD code (<code>brokerUserInstance.properties=params</code>, <code>brokerUserInstance.save()</code>, etc).  </p>

<p>This works fine in 1.1-beta3.  I can upload an image, it'll get thumbnailed and attached to the domain just fine (relations are in place in the db, etc).  When I update the broker object without uploading a new image, the old one it kept intact.</p>

<p>Moving to grails 1.1.1, when I try to upload a new image, I get:</p>

<pre><code>Error 500: org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: Image; nested exception is org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: Image
</code></pre>

<p>and if I don't upload an image, I get:</p>

<pre><code>[org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartFile] to required type [Image] for property logo; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert value of type [org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartFile] to required type [Image] for property logo: no matching editors or conversion strategy found
</code></pre>

<p>I'm able to find pretty much 0 on this issue.  Works fine in 1.1-beta3, but something's changed (dramatically) in 1.1.1 (and probably 1.1 as well).</p>

Sometimes (usually after the phone has been running for some time without a reset), I take my picture, and then select 'use' - but I get a nil image returned back in my delegate from the UIImagePickerController.  Once I've restarted the phone, everything goes back to normal for a while, but seems to eventually happen again.</p>

<p>This behaviour appears on iPhone devices for apps compiled using the 2.2.1, and 3.0 beta and final SDKs (and their associated ROM versions).</p>

1000815,Rotating view with nav controller on iPhone,"<p>my application has a tab bar containing nav controllers.</p>

<p>When I rotate, to landscape, I'm switching to a different view by pushing the landscape view onto the nav controller stack as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    - (void) orientationDidChange: (NSNotification *) notification {    
if (self.tabBarController.selectedViewController == self.navigationController) {
    if (self.navigationController.topViewController == self &amp;&amp; 
        [[notification name] isEqualToString: kOrientationLandscape]) {
        [self.navigationController pushViewController: landscapeViewController animated: NO];
    } 

    if (self.navigationController.topViewController != self &amp;&amp; 
        [[notification name] isEqualToString: kOrientationPortrait]) {
        [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated: NO];
    }
}

<p>}</p>

<p>This works fine, but when I rotate back to portrait, the view displays correctly and then 'jumps' up by what I'm guessing is the height of the nav bar. The top of the view is then hidden behind the navigation bar.</p>

<p>If I push another controller on top in the usual manner and then pop back to the portrait view it displays correctly - this only occurs when rotating back from landscape.</p>

<p>Also, it works fine in the simulator, but not on the iPhone. I'm building for 2.0, but it seems to be the same for later versions too.</p>

1035675,child process imports from debug runtime library cannot be resolved,"<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2005 Pro with SP1 under Windows XP 32 SP3 to build two native EXEs, A and B. A launches B. The following scenario occurs on my development system, which for now is also my test system.</p>

<p>When I link A and B against the debug version of the runtime library, A launches happily but then fails to launch B because the system's loader cannot find the debug version of the runtime library.</p>

<p>I have a theory about why this is so: The debugger has somehow put the debug version of the runtime library into the DLL search path in a way that doesn't propagate into A, so when the loader attempts to resolve B's imports, the debug version of the runtime library cannot be found.</p>

<p>What is the best way to overcome this? Finding the file which contains the debug version of the runtime library and adding its parent directory to the DLL search path seems like the most straightforward approach, but I can't help but wonder why the debugger hasn't done this for me. Perhaps it has a good reason which I should not attempt to second-guess.</p>

This behavior causes us many problems, since the proxy discards the whole http conversation, when it gets ""100 continue"".

1093419,Safely Grant Access to Replication Monitor to Create Snapshots,"<p>I have a database that I'm publishing to a remote site using Snapshot replication (only method that will work given the application and database schema).

1111368,Subsonic FetchByParameter versus Query,"<p>I am getting some memory errors when I attempt to pull back approx 150,000 or more rows into my collection using subsonic. Currently, I am getting an out of memory error when this occurs. Upon further review and debugging I am noticing that the following line seems to be the culprit of the error:</p>

<pre><code>OrdersCollection orders = new OrdersCollection();
orders.Load(Orders.FetchByParameter(Orders.Columns.OrderID, order.OrderID));
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering if <code>FetchByParameter</code> is the correct method I need to be using or if I need to possibly change that to the SubSonic.Query approach. </p>

1112893,Empty response during ajax request in Chrome but not IE nor FF,"<p>I am receiving an empty response when calling a web method using asp.net in Chrome but not IE nor FF.  I get this behavior using the ASP PageMethod.func as well as using jquery ajax call. </p>

<p>I can 'fix' the symptom by adding a delay sleep call on the server which makes me believe code is just plain wrong somewhere.  I have the <code>webkit</code> fix so that Chrome is using <code>webkit</code> (see the first line of the log).</p>

<p>I have created a simple test case.  The log of pressing each button from left to right is shown. Basically, without a sleep call on the server, the load fails > 95% of the time.  With a sleep(0) call its 50% and with a large sleep 1 sec it rarely (if ever?) fails.</p>

<p>If I remove the sleep and turn on Fiddler it never fails.  Something like the response not getting flushed??</p>

<p>Is there something obviously wrong with the test case or is this a bug.</p>

<p>With fiddler on the headers response looks like this and there is 51 bytes of data (not shown):</p>

<p>On insert and update date is passed in the different ways. And parsing '14.07.2009' results in out-of-range value.

1126366,EFPocoAdapter -- PopulatePocoEntity has null PocoEntity,"<p>I'm trying EF with the EFPocoAdapter for the first time.  I have a relatively simple TPH scenario with one table and two types, each inheriting from an abstract base class.</p>

<p>My model validates through EdmGen, and my PocoAdapter.cs and xxxEntities.cs files generate fine as well.  (well, actually, there are some namespace problems that I'm currently tweaking by hand until we figure out where to go next.)</p>

               select p;

  foreach (var alert in alerts)
  {
    Assert.IsNotNull(alert);
  }
}

I get an error in the PocoAdapter class, claiming that PocoEntity is null is the following method inside my base class's adapter:

public override void PopulatePocoEntity(bool enableProxies)
{
  base.PopulatePocoEntity(enableProxies);
  PocoEntity.Owner = _Owner.CreatePocoStructure();
  if (!(PocoEntity is IEntityProxy))
  {
  }
}

<p>Any ideas from anyone?</p>

<p>So, after a little more debugging, I think this is related to proxies.  Inside PocoAdapterBase we have the following method:</p>

<pre><code>protected PocoAdapterBase(TPocoClass pocoObject)
{
  _context = ThreadLocalContext.Current;
  bool allowProxies = false;
  if (_context != null)
  {
    allowProxies = _context.EnableChangeTrackingUsingProxies;
  }

  _pocoEntity = pocoObject ?? (TPocoClass)(allowProxies ? CreatePocoEntityProxy() : CreatePocoEntity());
   Init();
   InitCollections(allowProxies);
   RegisterAdapterInContext();
}

<p>The line that sets _pocoEntity calls CreatePocoEntityProxy, which returns null.</p>

1130920,Using Microsoft Web App Stress tool to stress test image uploading,"<p>I have developed a web application that I want to stress test. The app uses a Flash SWF to allow users to browse for images on their machine and upload them to the webserver. This SWF will read jpg images from the local file system, resize them and generate a thumbnail and then upload these as byteArray to an AMFPHP script that writes the byte arrays as .jpg files to the <code>webserver</code> records the image in the database and then sends the image to Amazon S3 for storage.</p>

<p>I have been trying to stress test this using WAS which works well because it records the header information sent and therefore the byte array so I can simulate multiple users - though all uploading the same images! :).</p>

<p>I am finding though that not all images are making it to S3 and not all images are being added to the database. I suspect that this due to the script needing more time than WAS allows in the delay field so my question is - </p>

<p>Is there a way to tell WAS to wait for a script to finish executing before moving on rather than sticking to the delay I have specified in the WAS interface? I am thinking that the AMFPHP script that receives the byte array and writes the file is not finishing before the 
image is being added to the database or sent to S3.</p>

<p>If I could force WAS to wait until it knows a script has completed I could see more clearly where any bottlenecks are. I am simulating about 100 clients (10 threads * 10 sockets) so presumably, this is placing a greater load on this step than can be handled! </p>

<p>Is this a more a case of the testing tool will not accurately simulate the real scenario as in reality Flash would wait to get a success response from AMFPHP that the image has been written before calling the script that creates a record in the database and sends the file to S3? Should I even combine these scripts into a single script so that this is not an issue?</p>

<p>This happens only with Aero (with and without Glass). If I activate the classical Window Scheme, everything behaves as under Windows XP (switching back with ALT+TAB leaves the child window active).</p>

<p>Any suggestions or links or other resources?</p>

<p>(Sample code is a bit hard to provide since the UI-elements are wrapped in classes with own data types for strings etc.)</p>

<p>It seems that Vista with classical scheme sends an WM_ACTIVATE to the main window and another WM_ACTIVATE to the second window (owned by the main window).
With Vista Aero enabled only the main windows gets an WM_ACTIVATE. Odd.</p>",,0,2,,2009. 7. 21 오전 10:32:04,,2020. 4. 28 오전 8:18:44,2020. 4. 28 오전 8:18:44,,2125010,,42809,,1,1,c++|windows-vista|aero|childwindow,376

Can someone show me how to fix my code or a way to do this? Rhanks!</p>

1165606,How can I create a totally dependent SWF from an existing dynamic one?,"<p>I manage a website that has ModX and for some reason, I just can't get dynamic SWF files to load. This is not normally a problem as I have a Flash menu creator program that makes static SWF files. However, this new one only makes dynamic SWFs (ones that rely on external files and XML). I've tried making a Projector of the file but with the same result: it still needs the external files. After much searching on Google, I have come across Adobe Flex. I have managed to import the main menu SWF file onto the stage using this code:</p>

<p><code>&lt;mx:SWFLoader id=""loader1"" source=""menu.swf"" scaleContent=""false"" autoLoad=""true"" width=""183"" height=""440"" alpha=""1.0"" left=""0"" top=""0""/&gt;</code></p>

<p>Also, I have referenced the folder of the source files (XML file, PNGs and other icon SWFs) and the menu shows up wonderfully in Flex itself. However, if I publish it as an SWF I end up with the same problem. It won't play on its own, without the dependent files. Could anyone take me through the code, step by step as to how to make an independent SWF file with a transparent background, please? </p>

<p>I can always provide more details if necessary. Please bear in mind that I'm almost a complete coding newbie. I'm really tearing my hair out here!

<p>I'm having some trouble finding a tool for verifying if a code respects certain coding rules.</p>

<p>For example I want to make sure of things like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>class names start with a C</li>
<li>class member names start with m_</li>
<li>global variables should start with g_</li>
<li>static variables should start with s_</li>
<li>comments should follow the doxygen rules</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a tool that can be customized to meet this requirements? (It doesn't matter if it's open source/free or commercial, though free would be nice ... ).</p>

<p>Even if parts of the requirements can be achieved it would be good.</p>

<p>PS: The customizing part is very important as the product may be used for other projects also, projects where the coding standards can be different</p>",,0,2,,2009. 7. 28 오전 8:46:52,2,2014. 2. 22 오전 12:30:51,2017. 5. 23 오후 12:06:13,,-1,,13136,,1,1,c++|coding-style|verification,379

<p>I've been looking all over StackOverflow and SubSonic Project and can't find how to perform one query using a SimpleRepository where I have a Product class with a Category.</p>

<p>Product contains a CategoryID and Category property to make up the POCO.  Category class of course contains CategoryID and CategoryName for the POCO.</p>

<p>When I try to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var repo = new SimpleRepository(""myDBConnection"");
var products = repo.All&lt;Product&gt;();

return View(products);
</code></pre>

<p>In the view I have an item.Category.CategoryName and that's where I get the runtime error.</p>

<p>Does SubSonic 3.0.0.3 resolve this issue?  Is there a workaround other than ActiveRecord and Linq Queries to create a new Anonymous Type object in the select?  Did I not find the question hidden away on S/O?</p>

<p>I'm starting to come to the end of my research of SubSonic for the project I'm working on and I'm probably going to start recommending a different ORM/DAL framework.  I've been running into a lot of problems where I really don't have enough documentation to go off of (SubSonicProject Docs or otherwise) to help me out and I'm starting to scramble for a new <strong><em>SOLID</em></strong> solution that will speed up my coding time to play catch up.</p>",,0,0,,2009. 7. 28 오후 3:05:51,,2009. 7. 28 오후 3:12:48,2017. 5. 23 오후 12:19:08,,-1,,125376,,1,1,subsonic3,404

1223548,Properties Expansion Languages (DSLs) - Do any exist?,"<p>Here's my problem:  We have N applications running in M different environments (qa/prod/etc.) with P servers per environment.  Multiplied out, the number of unique configurations is in the hundreds.  Each of these applications has a set of environment-specific properties (public hostname, listening port, max memory, etc.).</p>

<p>Multiplied out, there are thousands of properties to set.  However, the actual rules that define what the properties ought to be are significantly simpler.  For example, in production environments with two app instances per physical server, one app binds to port 8080 and the other to 8081.</p>

<p>Here's what I want:  A language (DSL) with which I can specify the rules that dictate what the property settings ought to be.  I'd like to avoid repeating myself.  The language ought to be declarative.  We're pretty Java-centric, but all I need do do is produce name/value pairs, so I'd hate to limit myself.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist?  I have found nothing.</p>

<p>I suppose I could use Drools or another rules engine, but that's awfully heavy for this purpose.  Property files are the lowest common denominator.  We can put them into war/ear files, use them to do template-based replacements during builds, etc.  There are certainly more elegant ways to solve problems of this nature, but we're kind of stuck with our architectures, at least in the short term.</p>",,0,0,,2009. 8. 3 오후 5:27:20,1,2009. 8. 3 오후 5:27:20,,,,,99107,,1,1,properties|build|dry|dsl,83

If I set <code>UseShellExecute = false</code> on the process's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">startinfo</a>, I get odd behaviour if I do any simultaneous image manipulation with the <a href=""http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeImageNet</a> library on the UI thread. The odd-behaviour is that when I go to close a new image via <code>CloseMultiBitmap()</code> the method appears to work, but it only leaves FICACHE and FISPOOL files, not the final image. If I set <code>UseShellExecute = true</code> everything works as expected. </p>

<p>The backgroundworker process calls ImageMagick's convert.exe commandline program. However, it happens if I run any command. It really appears to be due to the UseShellExecute property. I guarantee I am not working on the same image from different threads.</p>

<p>Basically, the program loads multi-paged tiff files for splitting and merging operations. When I load the tiffs, each page is extracted from the original and saved in a temp folder. Then I use the backgroundworker to generate preview images for each page.  This takes around half a second per page, so a 60 page tif can take some time to load. While loading the preview images, you can do merging and splitting. I only operate on the original image at this time.</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way for the website owner to be able to easily edit static html pages and inject them into the master view.  </p>

<p>I know I can do this with .ASCX files. I even have a route and controller that will inject an .ASCX whose name matches a parameter in the URL.  But is there a way to do it with HTML files?</p>

<p>For reference, the code that works with .ASCX files looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;% Html.RenderPartial((string)ViewData[""PageName""]); %&gt;

<p>The URL looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.mysite.com/staticpages/staticpagename.aspx

<pre><code>    public ActionResult RenderSpecifiedPage(string name)
    {
        ViewData[""PageName""] = name;
        return View(""Page"");
    }

            ""Pages"",                                                                        // Route name

1253451,Application hangs or crashes when unloading WinInet,"<p>I have a VC++ application that uses WinInet. It does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>calls <code>LoadLibrary()</code> to load WinInet.dll</li>
<li>calls <code>InternetAttemptConnect()</code></li>
<li>calls <code>InternetOpen()</code></li>
<li>calls <code>InternetConnect()</code> providing <code>INTERNET_SERVICE_FTP</code> as <code>dwService</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the last call fails (usually because of wrong password passed) <code>InternetConnect()</code> returns 0 and this should be handled by writing an error into the log and quitting the application.</p>

<p>When that happens the application calls <code>InternetCloseHandle()</code> for closing the handle returned by <code>InternetOpen()</code> and leaves <code>WinMain()</code>.</p>

<p>After that libraries unloading begins - either a static object holding a handle to wininet.dll is destriyed and <code>FreeLibrary()</code> is called or <code>FreeLibrary()</code> is called by Windows. In any case the call to <code>FreeLibrary()</code> either hangs or crashes.</p>

<p>Usually it hangs with the following call stack:</p>

<pre><code>ntdll.dll!KiFastSystemCallRet()     
ntdll.dll!NtWaitForSingleObject()  + 0xc    
kernel32.dll!WaitForSingleObject()  + 0x12

<ol>

<li><p>I go back to the web interface, click the name of the file, am prompted to view the file. I click ""OK"" and, to my horror, an automatic discard of the checkout is performed:
a. Registry entry deleted
b. File (WITH MY PRECIOUS CHANGES) is unceremoniously deleted</p></li>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>SubSonic and T4 templates in a C# class library project</li>
<li>My VB application in a separate project referencing the SubSonic project</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In my VB application, I am trying to call Find() on one of the SubSonic generated classes, like so:</p>

<pre><code>dim foo = Orders.Find(Function(myOrder as Order) myOrder.CustomerID = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This is failing in ActiveRecord.cs, in this method from the (generated) Order class at:</p>

<pre><code>public static IList&lt;Order&gt; Find(Expression&lt;Func&lt;Order, bool&gt;&gt; expression) {
    var repo = GetRepo();
    return repo.Find(expression).ToList();   '&lt;---- exception here
}
</code></pre>

<p>with the following exception</p>

<pre>
    SqlException was unhandled by user code
    Incorrect syntax near 'LESS_THAN_SIGN'
</pre>

<p>(Replace the <code>LESS_THAN_SIGN</code> with a less than sign; can't figure out the escaping in stackoverflow)</p>

<p>I don't have a problem when I call Find with a function that references the primary key, such as:</p>

<pre><code>dim foo = Orders.Find(Function(myOrder as Order) myOrder.OrderID = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>I also don't have a problem when I do this in C#.</p>

1269395,How to remove a TypeConverter Attribute from a Type?,"<p>I'm restating this problem to summarise what I've already found:</p>

<p>I have a test TypeConverter, (MyConverter), that for a ConvertToString will output ""Converted To String"", no matter what the input.</p>

<p>To ensure this is picked up by GetConverter for Int32, I add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>(1) Dim tcp As TypeDescriptionProvider = TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(GetType(Int32), New TypeConverterAttribute(GetType(MyConverter)))
</code></pre>

<p>Next:</p>

<pre><code>(2) Dim tc As TypeConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Int32)) // Get the Int32 converter
(3) Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12)) // The output is, as expected, ""Converted To String""
</code></pre>

<p>Next:</p>

<pre><code>(4) TypeDescriptor.RemoveProvider(tcp, GetType(Int32)) //Remove the TypeConverterAttribute associated with int32
(5) tc = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Int32)) //Get Int32 TypeConverter
(6) Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12)) //The output is STILL ""Converted To String""
</code></pre>

<p>However:</p>

<pre><code>Dim tcp As TypeDescriptionProvider = TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(GetType(Int32), New TypeConverterAttribute(GetType(MyConverter)))
TypeDescriptor.RemoveProvider(tcp, GetType(Int32)) //Immediately remove the provider
Dim tc As TypeConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Int32))
Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12)) //The output is, as expected, ""12""
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that line (2) is creating some other association that isn't being removed with RemoveProvider, since RemoveProvider works before that line, but not after.</p>

<p>Also, between lines (4) &amp; (5), if I do TypeDescriptor.GetAttributes(GetType(Int32)), the TypeConverterAttribute has, as expected, been removed.</p>

<p>Groan...Yet another ETA.</p>

<p>If before line (1) I add...</p>

<pre><code>Dim OriginalProvider As TypeDescriptionProvider = TypeDescriptor.GetProvider(GetType(Int32))
</code></pre>

<p>And then after line(4) I add...</p>

<pre><code>TypeDescriptor.AddProvider(OriginalProvider, GetType(Int32))
</code></pre>

<p>It works. But the original provider should have been the next on the stack anyway after I had removed my custom provider.</p>

<p><strong>ETA. I think I've nailed it.</strong></p>

<p>Ignore the last comment about re-adding the OriginalProvider.
Instead, after the line(4), add...</p>

<pre><code>TypeDescriptor.Refresh(GetType(Int32))
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, Refresh is not being called after the Remove.</p>

<p>If you'd used GetConverter on the Nullable Of the Type, you'll need to refresh the nullable as well. So if I'd said:</p>

<pre><code>Dim tc As TypeConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Nullable(Of Int32)))
</code></pre>

<p>After removing the provider, I'd need to type:</p>

<pre><code>TypeDescriptor.Refresh(GetType(Int32))
TypeDescriptor.Refresh(GetType(Nullable(Of Int32)))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>----Original Question----</strong></p>

<p>In order to force a nullable type to use a custom converter, I add a TypeConverterAttribute with the line:</p>

<pre><code>TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(GetType(Int32), New TypeConverterAttribute(GetType(MyConverter)))
</code></pre>

<p>That way, the following line will pick up a nullable converter with MyConverter as the underlying converter:</p>

<pre><code>Converter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Int32))
</code></pre>

<p>However, once I am finished, I can't see a way to disassociate MyConverter from Int32 as there is no TypeDescriptor.RemoveAttribute.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>ETA:</p>

<p>Ok, I'm half way there.</p>

<p>I found out that TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes returns a TypeDescriptionProvider that I can then remove. However, it's not working as expected. </p>

<p>This works:</p>

<pre><code>Dim tcp As TypeDescriptionProvider = TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(GetType(Int32), New TypeConverterAttribute(GetType(MyConverter)))
TypeDescriptor.RemoveProvider(tcp, GetType(Int32))
Dim tc As TypeConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Nullable(Of Int32)))
Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12)) '12 is output 
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the original converter is picked up, and MyConverter is ignored.</p>

<p>However, this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>Dim tcp As TypeDescriptionProvider = TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(GetType(Int32), New TypeConverterAttribute(GetType(MyConverter)))
Dim tc As TypeConverter = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Nullable(Of Int32)))
Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12))

TypeDescriptor.RemoveProvider(tcp, GetType(Int32))
tc = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(GetType(Nullable(Of Int32)))
Console.WriteLine(tc.ConvertToString(12)) 
</code></pre>

<p>After the RemoveProvider, the GetConverter still picks up MyConverter - just because I've moved it after the original GetConverter!</p>

<p>Again, any ideas?</p>

<p>ETA2:</p>

<p>I've got a work around by specifying the noCustomTypeDesc flag on the GetConverter Method, but I'd still like to know what's going on.</p>

<p>I've used TypeDescriptor.GetAttributes(GetType(Int32)) to list all the attributes after I've removed the provider, and the TypeConverterAttribute is, indeed, gone yet GetConverter continues to pick up MyConverter.</p>",,0,4,,2009. 8. 13 오전 12:12:33,1,2014. 3. 6 오후 2:06:51,2014. 3. 6 오후 2:06:51,,18782,,120399,,1,1,vb.net|attributes|typeconverter|typedescriptor,1765

1273969,GMaps controls broken in GWT 1.6+?,"<p>I've ported my GWT app to 1.7.0 from 1.5.2 and widgets that are used as a control on a GoogleMap no longer get ClickEvents. I've checked that the DOM insertion of the control is the same and there are no differences there. Since GWT 1.6 introduced a significant change in the way events are handled I'm thinking something has gone amis there.</p>

<p>I use a GWT image as a a GoogleMaps control:</p>

<pre><code>  Image control = new Image(""/oeg/images/info_32.png"");
</code></pre>

<p>Which I place on the map using the Mapitz GMaps lib (yes I know its old, but I have kept supporting a working version that is updated - if anyone is interested just ask) </p>

<pre><code> GControlPosition infoPosition = 
      new GControlPosition(GControlAnchor.G_ANCHOR_TOP_RIGHT(),
                           new GSize(7, 30)); 
  getGmap().addControl(new GControl(control, infoPosition)); 
</code></pre>

<p>I've checked the compiled code and it literally just puts the html element on the map as a GControl just the way you'd expect and as I said I've checked the DOM to make sure nothing looks funny. </p>

<p>to get ClickEvents I used to do this... </p>

<pre><code>  control.addClickListener(new ClickListener() { 
        public void onClick(Widget sender) 
        { 
            doTipOfTheDay(); 
        } 
    }); 
</code></pre>

<p>which I changed to this in the 1.6.0 world, </p>

<pre><code>  control.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() { 
        public void onClick(ClickEvent ce) 
        { 
            doTipOfTheDay(); 
        } 
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried explicitly sinking the click event with</p>

<pre><code>   control.sinkEvents(Event.ONCLICK);
</code></pre>

<p>but none of this works in GWT-1.6.0/1.7.0 and it all worked fabulously in 1.5.2</p>

<p>Can anyone shed some light on this? Has anyone else run into event issues w/ controls on GMaps with GWT 1.6 and above? </p>

<p>I would like the event setup such as what you see above to be implemented in the above interface.  </p>

<p>When you setup a delegate in the interface.  No errors.  But when you try to implement the delegate in the userControl Visual studio says ""Delegates cannot implement interface methods""

Sub ValidStatusChangedHandler(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e AsValidStatusChangedEventArgs)  
Event ValidStatusChanged As EventHandler

<p>Most relevant point being that I ValidStatusChangedHandler is declared as a Sub not a delegate.</p>

<p>I implemented those in my derived class as follows...  </p>

<pre><code>Protected Event ValidStatusChanged As EventHandler Implements IWizardUserControl.ValidStatusChanged

Protected Sub ValidStatusChangedHandler(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ValidStatusChangedEventArgs) Implements IWizardUserControl.ValidStatusChangedHandler
    OnValidStatusChanged(e.ValidStatus)
End Sub

Private Sub OnValidStatusChanged(ByVal status As Boolean) Implements IWizardUserControl.OnValidStatusChanged

1286802,Winforms DataTable Convert to Excel,"<p>In asp.net, it is quite easy to convert a datatable to an excel file.  How do I do the same for datatables in winforms?</p>

<p>For Example:  in my asp.net code, here is my function to convert the datatable to excel:</p>

<pre><code>Public Shared Sub DataTableToExcel(ByVal dt As DataTable, ByVal FileName As String
  HttpContext.Current.Response.Clear()
  HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(Environment.NewLine)
  For Each row As DataRow In dt.Rows
    For i As Integer = 0 To dt.Columns.Count - 1
      HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(row(i).ToString().Replace("";"", String.Empty) + "";"")
    Next

    HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(Environment.NewLine)
  Next

  HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = ""application/ms-excel""
  HttpContext.Current.Response.AppendHeader(""Content-Disposition"", ""attachment; filename="" + FileName + "".xls"")
  HttpContext.Current.Response.[End]()
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>But in winforms, you cannot use the same as it is. You need to read out the datatable and create/open the excel workbook.</p>

<p>I wish there is a way to directly convert datatable used in winforms to excel fast.</p>

1290814,Is the OnAdded field event fired when a content type is added to a list?,"<p>Say I have a custom field type called MyCoolField that I have deployed in a solution. This solution also contains a SPEventReceivers that has overridden ItemAdded, ItemUpdated, and ItemDeleting.

<p>After this solution has been deployed, I activate a site-scoped feature that does nothing except add a new site content type - MyContentType.  Now, I would not expect any event receivers registered anywhere, since <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spcontenttype.parentlist.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ParentList is supposed to be null for site content types</a>.  </p>

The question I have is whether I should expect the <code>OnAdded</code> method to get called now (when adding a content type to the list) or does it only get called when adding the <strong>field</strong> to list/content type?

1300473,Flex Populating Tree Control From DataSet,"<p>Am currently working on a Tree control, and being my first time to delve into this, I need your inputs and advice.</p>

<p>My tree control is retrieving data from a .NET web service.  My .NET webservice returns a string which is parsed from a dataset via the command DataSet.GetXML method.</p>

<pre><code>Function MyFunc() as String
  'Populate the dataset here
  '.......
  Return DataSet.GetXML()
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>In my flex application, I am converting the string value returned by the webservice into an XML:</p>

<pre><code>private var _xmlMyData:XML;

private function myResultHandler(event:ResultEvent) :void
{
  _xmlMyData = XML(event.result);
  // This script to view the XML data in Text Area
  var strData:String = String(event.result);
  taData.text = strData;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which I am then passing to my xmlListCollection control</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mx:XMLListCollection id=""xmllc_myData"" source=""{_xmlMyData.Table}"" /&gt;
&lt;mx:TextArea id=""taData"" width=""300"" height=""100"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then binding to my tree control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mx:Tree id=""treeOffshore"" dataProvider=""{xmllc_myData}"" labelField=""DESCN"" showRoot=""false""&gt;
&lt;/mx:Tree&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When viewing the data in the text area control, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;NewDataSet&gt;
  &lt;Table&gt;
    &lt;CODE&gt;A1&lt;/CODE&gt;
    &lt;DESC&gt;Area One&lt;/DESC&gt;
  &lt;/Table&gt;

  &lt;Table&gt;    
    &lt;CODE&gt;B2&lt;/CODE&gt;
    &lt;DESC&gt;Base Two&lt;/DESC&gt;
  &lt;/Table&gt;

  &lt;Table&gt;
    &lt;CODE&gt;C4&lt;/CODE&gt;
    &lt;DESC&gt;Class Four&lt;/DESC&gt;
  &lt;/Table&gt;

  &lt;Table&gt;
    &lt;CODE&gt;D8&lt;/CODE&gt;
    &lt;DESC&gt;Demo Eight&lt;/DESC&gt;
  &lt;/Table&gt;
&lt;/NewDataSet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the treeview renders:</p>

<pre><code>Area One
  A1
  Area One
Base Two
  B2
  Base Two
Class Four
  C4
  Class Four
Demo Eight
  D8
  Demo Eight
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is to be able to define the Description only at the first level only:</p>

<pre><code>Area One
Base Two
Class Four
Demo Eight
</code></pre>

<p>The next thing that I need to accomplish is that the second level of the treeview should actually be populated based on the CODE from the first level.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Area One
  Sub Item Area One
  Sub Item Area Two
Base Two
  Sub Item Base Two
  Sub Item Base Three
  Sub Item Base Four
Class Four
  Sub Item Class Four
Demo Eight
  Sub Item Demo Eight
  Sub Item Demo Nine
  Sub Item Demo Ten
  Sub Item Demo Eleven
</code></pre>

<p>I am quite new in this tree control thing (as well as flex) and have limited grasp of the concepts to be able to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I am thinking either of modifying the XML data which I originally retrieve and probably insert the sub items per each node, although I am in a bind of how to accomplish the same.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to give some of you further details, the treeview data would actually be coming from three tables where the table 1 is the base table, and the table 2 contains the children of table 1 and table 3 contains children data from table 3.</p>

<p>I would sincerely appreciate your inputs on this.  I am foraying into the world of Flex and this is quite a make or break scenario towards embracing this technology in our organization.</p>

<p>I have an InfoPath 2007 form, for which the programming for parts of the form (mostly changed events) were done in C#.  I am trying to convert these to VB, but, I am having an issue with DataConnection.Execute()</p>

<p>I have run several tests (not illustrated in the examples) to prove that I am, in fact, getting the proper variables, such as 'strWO'.  This variable is then passed to the DataSource ""Discrepancies"", which is a stored procedure.</p>

<p>If I invoke the SP Discrepancies through my WebMethod (also converted to VB), it does in fact, return the information it should.  That is all well and good.  I get the information that I expect.</p>

<p>But, the VB version, does not execute the query.  Doing a simple test on node counts, I get '0.'  Whereas the particular item I am testing, should return a node count in the low 40's.  There is data to be had, yet, I cannot get the query to execute.  And it's driving me mad.</p>

<p>Some of the variable names are different from c# to vb, as well as some infoPath xPaths, which I have simplified down to just <em>xpath</em> for readability.  Some of those xPaths get pretty long. But, I am positive that any variable name changes are consistent.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

1316718,Resizing Mfc dialog with embeded QWinWidget,"<p>I asked my question on qt centre forum, but no answer yet.<br />
Hope someone will know something about this. </p>

<p>I have an Mfc dialog with QWinWidget inside it. 
When I resize my dialog I want my QWinWidget to automatically
be resized and repositioned as well. This is the code that creates the QWinWidget inside the mfc dialog:</p>

<pre><code>int MyCDialog::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct)
{
   if (CDialog::OnCreate( lpCreateStruct ) == -1 )
            return -1;
    win=new QWinWidget( this-&gt;m_hWnd );
        MyFrame * dialog=new MyFrame(win);   
    win-&gt;move(0,0);     
    win-&gt;show(); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>MyFrame is derived from QFrame object. The QFrame object is made
with Qt designer. QFrame has assigned layout, which supposes to do geometrical management of QFrame child widgets. </p>

<p>Here is the code that executes when I drag the resizing border of my dialog:</p>

<pre><code>void MyCDailog::OnSize(UINT nType,int cx,int cy)
{
   QObjectList list=win-&gt;children();
   QFrame* p=(QFrame*) list.at(0);
   p-&gt;resize(QSize(cx,cy));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the dialog is resized I am calling the resize method of my frame object from OnSize, and I was expecting that after I do resize to the frame, the frame should resize and reposition its child widgets according to their size hint and size polices. But this is not happening, at least not as it should. What I am doing wrong?</p>",,0,3,,2009. 8. 22 오후 6:50:35,,2020. 4. 28 오전 9:26:46,2020. 4. 28 오전 9:26:46,,2125010,,152508,,1,1,qt|qt-mfc-migration,1151

What I would like to do is have an object injected and have a new instance created on each session.  I've looked at the OnePerRequest behavior and it's close, but not quite.
What I'm doing is performing a lot of calculations, and those
variables are held in objects that are injected into the page.  I need
those objects to stay around for postbacks, but I want a new instance
of the objects each time the user ""Visits"" the site.  My initial
thinking was to use the Asp.net Session object in some way to store
the values between postbacks,  This is the way I would do it before Ninject (just store the objects in session.  but I'd like to use Ninject in the correct way if I can.
I'm open to other suggestions.  I thought about using the Singleton, but each user is going to need their own copy of the object, otherwise they'll step on each others
calculations.</p>

507743,VS Installer Custom Action Question,"<p>If you have a web app merge module and an exe merge module included in the same setup-deployment project, the Context.Parameters[""AssemblyPath""] value inside the custom action for each merge module gets messed up. Try creating a setup-deployment project that has a web project and an app project like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Web project</li>
<li>Create a merge module for that web project</li>
<li>Create a regular App project</li>
<li>Create a merge module for that app</li>
<li>Create a setup project that has both the above merge modules</li>
<li>Create a project for custom installer.</li>
<li>In the Commit() method override, access Context.Parameters[""AssemblyPath""] and debug print out the value.</li>
<li>Add this custom action project output to both your merge modules.
Now do the install.
You would expect different values to be printed depending on which merge module is calling this custom action. But they are the same ! Sometimes it is c:\inetpub\wwwroot and sometimes it is C:\MyAppDir...</li>
</ol>

<p>The merge module files do end up in the right place though:<br>
The Web project content goes to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\<br>
while the App project goes to 'module retargetable folder'.<br>
You will also notice the customactions.dll included in each merge module will end up in the right places (c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ in once case and 'module retargetable folder' in the other').  </p>

<p>But the debug print out of Context.Parameters[""AssemblyPath""] will show the same value in BOTH cases (ie both merge modules). It will both be C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\CustomActions.dll
or <code>&lt;targetdir&gt;</code>\CustomActions.dll. This is wrong !  </p>

<p>The debug print should show<br>

<p>I have a subreport in a reporting services main report.  The subreport starts approximately on the middle of the page in the main report.  If i have few detail lines in the subreport so that all can be rendered on page one, everything is ok.  However, if I have more detail lines in the subreport so that it's not possible to print all on page one the entire subreport moves to page two.  I don't want that to happen, how can that be avoided ?</p>

<p>I also noticed that if I have more than one page of data in the subreport, it is also started on page one, and flows like I want.  I want to avoid the situation where I have more lines than can be fitted on page one, and still fewer lines than one page.  I thought the KeepTogether property controlled this, but it's set to false in my report.</p>

<p>This leads me to thinking that the default Form Region template actually keeps a reference to the Contact it is being shown for and not disposing of it after the form region is closed. This causes the contact to be in memory and not simply disposed after closing the form.</p>

730568,"Best way to do arrays in gsoap, considering WSDL compliance and performance","<p>I'm using gsoap to generate an XML SOAP parser and WSDL grammar, and was wondering what is the recommended way to express a static array that is both fast to parse and generates a corresponding WSDL that passes all the validation tests (like Eclipse WSDL Validator or NetBeans Validate XML).</p>

<p>If I use this input into gsoap:</p>

<pre><code>struct ns__ArrayOfSomeInts { xsd__int ints[10]; };
</code></pre>

<p>I get this resulting WSDL (within definitions/types/schema tags):</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;complexType name=""ArrayOfSomeInts""&gt;
   &lt;sequence&gt;
     &lt;element name=""ints"" type=""ns:Array10Ofxsd__int"" minOccurs=""1"" maxOccurs=""1"" nillable=""true""/&gt;
   &lt;/sequence&gt;
  &lt;/complexType&gt;
  &lt;complexType name=""Array10Ofxsd__int""&gt;

     &lt;attribute ref=""SOAP-ENC:arrayType"" WSDL:arrayType=""xsd:int[]""/&gt;
    &lt;/restriction&gt;
   &lt;/complexContent&gt;
  &lt;/complexType&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Running this through NetBeans ""Validate XML"" gives this error:</p>

<ul>
<li>ERROR: src-resolve: Cannot resolve the name 'SOAP-ENC:Array' to a(n) 'type definition' component.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eclipse WSDL Validator gives these two errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>WS-I: (BP2108) An Array declaration uses - restricts or extends - the soapenc:Array type, or the wsdl:arrayType attribute is used in the type declaration.</li>
<li>WS-I: (BP2122) A wsdl:types element contained a data type definition that is not an XML schema definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can clean up these errors by changing the gsoap code to define a dynamic array as such:</p>

<pre><code>struct ns__ArrayOfSomeInts { int __size; xsd__int *ints; };
</code></pre>

<p>(with corresponding WSDL:)</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;complexType name=""ArrayOfSomeInts""&gt;

754096,Changing domain password from TS box inside VPC VM,"<p>I'm running a VirtualPC 2007 VM with Windows2003 as the OS.  Inside of this I am using a web based VPN to connect to my client's network.  I cannot use this VPN from my host machine because it does not work with Vista (still!).  Inside the VM I'm connecting to a Terminal Server at the client site which I'm logging into using their domain.</p>

<p>I need to change my password.  Obviously what you would normally do is hit ctrl-alt-del and click change password.  However since I'm inside of a TS inside of a VM this is not an option.  When logging in to the VM I have to press alt-(left arrow)-del and then type in my password.  I also know that usually when using remote desktop, in order to simulate a ctrl-alt-del inside there you would press ctrl-alt-end.  With this knowledge, I've tried every possible combination of these keys that I can think of, but none of them bring up the Windows Security Dialog Box.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is either</p>

<ol>
<li>A way to open the Windows Security Dialog Box (or simply the change password form from there) without pressing ctrl-alt-del (is there a command line I can use?)</li>
<li>A different way to change my domain password without using the aforementioned box</li>

857365,WPF - Multibinding from Two Sources inside the ListBox DataTemplate,"<p>I tried to look around to see if I am missing something basic, but I can't seem to understand what I am doing wrong. </p>

<p>I have a listbox where I would like to bind the itemssource to a collectionview of photos from a dataset. The problem is, I need to take the directory where the images exist from the MasterView CollectionView, and the individual filenames from the DetailView CollectionView. So I defined the resources:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;CollectionViewSource x:Key=""MasterView"" /&gt;
&lt;CollectionViewSource Source=""{Binding Source={StaticResource MasterView}, Path='tblGallery_tblPictures'}"" x:Key=""DetailView"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work without a problem, I can navigate through the data set and see the Master and Detail data.</p>

<p>To get the full image path, I figured out that I needed a multibinding to put the two together, and have sucessfully created one:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;ListBox HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch""
    VerticalAlignment=""Stretch""
    ItemsSource=""{Binding Source={StaticResource DetailView}}""&gt;
    &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
       &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
         &lt;Image Width=""120""
            Stretch=""Uniform""
            Margin=""8,8,8,8""&gt;
            &lt;Image.Source&gt;
              &lt;BitmapImage DecodePixelWidth=""120""&gt;

                  &lt;MultiBinding Converter=""{StaticResource imagePathConverter}""&gt;
                    &lt;Binding Source=""{StaticResource MasterView}"" Path=""galleryLocation"" /&gt;
                    &lt;Binding Path=""pictureFileName"" /&gt;
                  &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;
                 &lt;/BitmapImage.UriSource&gt;
                &lt;/BitmapImage&gt;
               &lt;/Image.Source&gt;
             &lt;/Image&gt;                        
          &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

     &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;
        &lt;WrapPanel Orientation=""Horizontal"" HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" /&gt;
     &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;
   &lt;/ListBox.ItemsPanel&gt;
 &lt;/ListBox&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>My assumption with the proceeding code, is that the MultiBinding that is inside the DataTemplate has access to the BindingSource that is defined as the
ItemsSource from the listbox. However when I look into the MultiValueConverter code it only passes the data from the MasterView and a generic object for the second value.</p>

<p>To see if I could get it to work, I added the detail source information in the multibinding:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MultiBinding Converter=""{StaticResource imagePathConverter}""&gt;
  &lt;Binding Source=""{StaticResource MasterView}"" Path=""galleryLocation"" /&gt;
  &lt;Binding Source=""{StaticResource DetailView}"" Path=""pictureFileName"" /&gt;
&lt;/MultiBinding&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That at least enabled me to see that there were 5 pictures in the listbox, but they were all the same picture. It seems that the multibinding access to the DetailView CollectionView only showed the first item. </p>

<p>Is there a way to link the ""pictureFileName"" to the current ItemsSource item so that the right picture can be displayed?</p>

883293,"SP3 installed, vs. SP3 slipstreamed, difference in default security settings?","<p>A Lotus Notes installation, Domino 7x, which ends up trying to start a IBM SameTime 7.5.1 chat client, fails on some machines.</p>

<p>Specifically, it fails on Windows XP machines that has SP3 slipstreamed, whereas Windows XP machines which has had SP3 installed afterwards, works fine.</p>

<p>The problem can be worked around temporarily by adjusting the advanced settings in Internet Explorer, related to Active Content:</p>

<pre><code>[ ] Allow active content from CDs to run on My Computer
</code></pre>

<p>Setting that <code>[x]</code> there makes the whole thing work, removing it (which is the default setting), makes it not work. But as I said, this setting is disabled on the machines that had SP3 installed afterwards, and it works there.</p>

<p>This isn't an acceptable solution, so we need to figure out the root cause of this.</p>

<p>What happens is that as part of the initialization process, Lotus Notes downloads a small web page. This web page contains javascript, that simply runs window.open with an url that points to the SameTime server, including session id, etc.</p>

<p>If I take this url, and pastes it into the address bar in Notes, everything works exactly as expected.</p>

<p>As such, I believe that the problem is somehow related to Notes not allowing the script to run at all.</p>

<p>Process Monitor shows that Notes does not do any sort of network query against that server after the web page was downloaded (I can see the point where it is written to disk), so I believe the problem is with the javascript handling.</p>

<p>So, the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone know of any specific security differences between installing SP3, and slipstreaming SP3, that could impact this?</li>
<li>Does anyone have any other ideas for what specifically we can try to adjust on the machine in order to get this working?</li>

<p>Here's the closest I've come:</p>

<pre><code>    public MainControl()
    {
        // Required to initialize variables
        InitializeComponent();

    {
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(@""soundfile.wav"");
        request.BeginGetResponse(ReadCallback, request); 
    }

    private void ReadCallback(IAsyncResult asynchronousResult)
    {
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)asynchronousResult.AsyncState;
        HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.EndGetResponse(asynchronousResult);

        WaveMediaStreamSource wavMss = new WaveMediaStreamSource(response.GetResponseStream());
        MediaPlayer.SetSource(wavMss);
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
It turns out the problem had to do with HttpWebRequest. Changing the code to:</p>

<pre><code>        public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
        webClient.OpenReadCompleted += new OpenReadCompletedEventHandler(webClient_OpenReadCompleted);
        webClient.OpenReadAsync(new Uri(@""http://www.russellmyers.com/somefile.wav"", UriKind.Absolute));
    }

    void webClient_OpenReadCompleted(object sender, OpenReadCompletedEventArgs e)
    {


        WaveMediaStreamSource wavMss = new WaveMediaStreamSource(e.Result);
        Debug.WriteLine(""Setting source..."");

<p>But I can't get it to work on the .NET site. Of course I need to change RC2CryptoServiceProvider to AESCryptoServiceProvider and CspParameters must be initialized with 24 instead of 1. My problem is how to get working the PasswordDerivedBytes, what are the exact parameter value needed?</p>

989633,Standards for queries over SOAP,"<p>Is there a standards-sanctioned XML format for describing entity queries? </p>

<p>Background: I plan to build a library for writing queries over WCF services.  </p>

<p>On the client I want to be able to write (C#):</p>

<pre><code>var customers = from c in service.Customers
                where c.Name.StartsWith(""P"")
                order by c.Name
                select c;
</code></pre>

<p>I will use a custom serializer to turn the LINQ query into an XML format to send as part of the SOAP body to the server. Maybe it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;query&gt;
  &lt;fetch entity=""Customer""&gt;
     &lt;all-attributes /&gt;
     &lt;filter type=""and""&gt;
       &lt;condition attribute=""Name"" operator=""starts-with"" value=""P"" /&gt;
     &lt;/filter&gt;
     &lt;order-by attribute=""Name"" /&gt;
  &lt;/fetch&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On the server side, the operation would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public ResultSet Query(Query query)
{
    using (var dataContext = new AdventureWorksDataContext()) 
    {
        var expression = query.ToExpressionTree();
        var sqlQuery = dataContext.CreateQuery(expression);
        return ResultSet.From(sqlQuery);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the query is just XML, my hope is other clients will also be able to use it easily enough. </p>

<p>My question is, is there already an XML schema that describes queries like this?</p>

<p>The one that inspired me was Microsoft CRM's FetchXML:</p>

<p>One possible strategy would be for the entire project to be in folder that is read-only to some users and writable to the others. Then you can have another folder that is writeable to all users.

<p>1) Put the image in a scroll view and let users pan and zoom. This doesn't seem like it would have the same effect as when you pan around the streetview, objects near the edges stretch to give you a ""lens"" type effect. </p>

<p>2) Apply a transform to the image before drawing it in a scroll view, and reapply the transform during scrolling. This transform would create the lens effect on the currently viewed part of the image.</p>

<p>3) Use open GL to create a hollow sphere and apply the image as a texture on the inside of the sphere.</p>

<li>doesn't seem like it would work</li>
<li>seems like my best option but I don't know what transform to use in quartz to create this effect. I like this though because it uses a scroll view and I don't have to recreate the panning, flicking and pinching code. </li>

1110712,How to prevent pressing ALT in modal dialog in IE not switch to hidden menu,"<p>When creating a dialog using window.showModalDialog (where the options do not display any addressbar or toolbar) from javascript in IE - the behavior of pressing the ALT key is doing something undesirable.</p>

<p>When you hit the ALT key when focus is on the modal dialog - the ALT key press event is handled by my javascript code fine, but whether I allow the event to continue to bubble up or not - it seems like IE is always jumping the focus to a 'hidden' menu in the modal dialog.  You can get to this menu from a modal dialog by hitting ALT, and then space.</p>

<p>Sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>From a modal dialog, user hits the ALT key</li>
<li>My event handling code catches this ALT key and does something</li>
<li>User hits another key</li>
<li>My event handling code (for any keyup) is not executed, seems like b/c the focus was on the alt+space menu, and the last key press jumped focus back to the modal dialog</li>
<li>User hits another key</li>
<li>My event handling code is executed as normal</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the features I'm supplying to <code>showModalDialog</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var strFeatures = ""unadorned:yes,resizable:no;scroll:yes;help:no;status:no;"";
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to prevent focus to the hidden menu after hitting the alt-key for modal dialogs?

1112790,"Possible to create UITabBarController w/ Custom Images, Pressed/NotPressed?","<p>I want to add a little flair to my application and while I have been somewhat successful, I haven't figured out a way to truly do what I want to do. I would try to subclass UITabViewController, but I don't think I would even know where to start or if that is the right approach. </p>

<p>Basically, what I want to do is have custom images for each tab bar button. I have both pressed and non-pressed images. Instead of using the highlight that is generated over the current icon, I want the pressed image to be shown. What I've been able to do is create a Category of the UITabBar with a custom drawRect method that basically draws all of my custom tab bar icons. I then initialize the same amount of UITabBarItems w/out specifying an image or title of any kind which I then add to the array of items. This lets me have my icons and then just overlays the highlight on them. </p>

<p>This is ok I guess, but I would really like to have the pressed button look. </p>

<p>Here is the code I use for drawing the tab bar:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation UITabBar (CustomImage)


-(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect
{
    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""TabBar.png""];
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0,0,320,50)];
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And then I initialize the tab bar items like this:</p>

<pre><code>UITabBarItem *homeTabBarItem = [[UITabBarItem alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone knows how I would do this, that would be greatly appreciated. Please keep in mind that I'm still relatively new to Objective-C, so I'm somewhat confused as to how I would correctly subclass anything at this point. </p>

<p>You will note that there is a difference in the way that the Expires &amp; Last-Modified is treated between the main page request and the image request. </p>

<p>To my minds eye the image one is correct because the Expires header is Last-Modified + max-age, but in the main page request, the Expires header is the same as the Last-Modified. I need both to be Last-Modified + max-age...</p>

1145298,Model for Resource Allocation,"<p>I'm working on a time management project and looking for some practical object/persistence models. Fowler has some great ideas on resource allocation in his Analysis Patterns book, but many are overkill for what I need right now, and by design, highly conceptual (as opposed to implementable)</p>

<p>The focal conceptual object I'm thinking of would be an Allocation object, which looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>Allocation: Entity
-------------
Id : Id
ResourceId : Id
AtivityId : Id
EventDate ; DateTime
TimeSpent : TimeQuantity
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also thinking this would be a database table, although I'm not sure if it would be an associative table between Resources and Activities, or a stand-alone lookup table (with the domain enforcing referential integrity).</p>

<p>The other two conceptual objects would be the Resource and the Activity. Both would have a set of Allocations, but after that, I'm a bit stuck in thinking out the interfaces. Different types of StaffMembers and Consultants are Resources of interest. The primary interest of an Activity would be based on a Project, with NonProject activities based on various payroll Accounts.</p>

<p>This is a C# project using NHibernate.</p>

<p>I realize this is a broad question, and not really a question about programming per se. If anyone knows of a more appropriate forum to discuss this, that would be great. If you also have some experience with this domain and have some ideas or links you are willing to share, that would be fantastic!</p>

<h1>RESPONSE TO ORBMAN</h1>

<p>Good questions:  </p>

<p>1) Whose time is tracked (Resources), which can be<br>
    - FullTimeStaff<br>
    - AdminStaff<br>
    - Consultants  </p>

<p>2) Recording period is weekly<br>
    - User can enter and revise time spent at any time prior to posting<br>
    - Timesheets must be posted for department manager review every week (Sunday)
        (System will not let the user post unless weekly quotas are met)<br>
    - A manager has until the following Tuesday to approve/reject   </p>

<p>3) Time must be allocated to Activities, which are two basic types<br>
    - Project based activities<br>
    - Non-project activities (which winds up posted to various P/R accounts)  </p>

<p>4) reports by either a Resource or an Activity s/b available over ad hoc time periods.  </p>

<p>The main problem I hit centers around the polymorphism needed for both Resource and Activity and how it should be persisted. In the domain it's more useful to have an IResource or <code>IActivity</code>, both of which implement <code>IAllocatable</code>: </p>

<pre><code>UniqueId : Id
BusinessId : string
Description : string
Allocations : ISet
</code></pre>

<p>The constraint that a Resource can only allocate time to an Activity is what makes them different (Activity needs a ClockIn method and Resource does not). Both need to be wrappers for well known objects that serve other purposes in the system (ie, StaffMember, Project).</p>

<p>I need a unique id for persistence and maybe a surrogate key for the allocation itself. I'm also not sure if there must be referential integrity between the allocations and the wrapped resources / activities and how to map that if so. I have been using Fluent NHibernate but I think it might wind up being easier to just use NHibernate.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the good questions.</p>",,0,3,,2009. 7. 17 오후 7:43:34,,2020. 4. 28 오전 8:26:13,2020. 4. 28 오전 8:26:13,,2125010,,95245,,1,2,c#|model|nhibernate-mapping,829

1171099,Security configuration when using custom binding in WCF,"<p>I'm about to port an application to silverlight. Until now my client application talked to the server using netTcpBinding. However Silverlight doesn't support that, and I found out that they recommend to use a custom binding instead.</p>

<p>I'd like to know wether I need to configure the binding in a special way regarding security. My distributed application works well when the client and the server are running in the same machine but not when running in different ones. In this case I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The message with action
  '<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/CreateSequence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/CreateSequence</a>'
  cannot be processed at the receiver,
  due to a ContractFilter mismatch at
  the EndpointDispatcher. This may be
  because of either a contract mismatch
  (mismatched Actions betwwen sender and
  receiver) or a binding/security
  mismatch between the sender and the
  revceiver. Check that sender and
  receiver have the same contract and
  the same binding (including security
  requirements, e.g. Message, Transport,
  None).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have already checked the contract and the binding (the problem arises when switching to custom binding while it works ok with netTcpBinding). The port is enabled at the firewall too. Based on the error message I think WCF may be asuming some security defaults which doesn't match in the client and the server.</p>

<p>I have N Entities (each with a possible parent and possible M children) in an <strong>iterative realtime simulation</strong> environment. Each entity is placed in a server environment where it is located on <strong>1 computer and 1 thread on that computer</strong>. Each entity has a <strong>""computer fragmentation cost"" and ""thread fragmentation cost""</strong>, which is a value from 0->1 (with 1 being the most expensive) that defines <strong>how painful/costly</strong> it will be to have that <strong>entity's children on different computers or threads</strong>. ""computer fragmentation cost"" will be higher than ""thread fragmentation cost"". </p>

<p>I have 2 operation. A ""add"" operation that's executed when a entity is initially added. I also have a ""defragment"" operation that runs at the end of every Y iterations that relocates entities to different threads/computers.</p>

<p>What is a general algorithm/guideline that makes sure the fragmentation stays at a minimum for those 2 operations, given the fragmentation costs?</p>

<p>Also, each entity is created from a predefined template. There will be a matrix defining the fragmentation costs between every pair of entity template. How can this additional data be used to lower fragmentation?</p>

<p>I've gotten past most of my versioning issues by using a custom binding, but I'm stuck on one last point.  The web service includes two BinarySecurityToken elements in the response SOAP envelope -- one for the encrypting certificate, one for the signing certificate.</p>

1299344,Partial update of WPF Animations in Storyboards/ParallelTimelines without a new Begin()?,"<p>I'm working on a WPF application that displays a number of graphical elements (RectangleGeometries and Splines) that are animated in sync with video displayed in a MediaElement.</p>

<p>The synchronization tree is constructed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Storyboard</strong> (for control: Begin(), Pause(), Seek() ...)

<ul>
<li><strong>MediaTimeline</strong> (connected to the MediaElement using Storyboard.SetTargetName())</li>
<li><strong>ParallelTimeline</strong>0 (subdivided in ParallelTimelines to ease object management)

<ul>
<li><strong>KeyframeAnimation</strong>0 (animates some graphical element)</li>
<li><strong>KeyframeAnimation</strong>1 (animates some other graphical element)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>... (possible more ParallelTimelines...)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the dynamic nature of the elements being displayed and animated, all of this is constructed and managed in code, i.e., no XAML. Setting this up and playing, seeking, etc., works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing, however, is the following.</p>

<p>The animated elements can be updated (e.g., Animation KeyFrames are updated, added, removed, ...) from time to time, while the video is still being shown, albeit likely in paused state. Simply updating the original animations has no effect since frozen copies (Freezable) of all animations are apparently used during Storyboard playback (looking at the source code, this freezing seems to occur in the Begin() method when clocks are allocated and animations are applied to Dependency Properties).

1329796,Determine whether a class has a function,"<p>Using a trick (described by <a href=""http://blog.olivierlanglois.net/index.php/2007/09/01/what_is_the_c_sfinae_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olivier Langlois</a>), I can determine whether a class has a type defined:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct hasType
{
    template&lt;typename C&gt; static char test( typename C::Type );
    template&lt;typename C&gt; static char* test(...);
    enum{ Value= sizeof(test&lt;T&gt;(0))==1 };
};
</code></pre>

<p>I can also determine whether a class has a variable:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct hasType
{
    template&lt;typename C&gt; static char test( decltype(C::var) );

<p>However, neither <code>decltype(c::func)</code> nur <code>decltype(c::func())</code> (which depends on the parameters) works for member functions.
Is there a way to do this or will I have to create a functor in every class and detect it with <code>typename C::functor</code>?</p>

<p><b>Edit</b>: You're both right, but since I'll also have to test for a type I'll use <code>decltype(&amp;C::func)</code> (which should obviously be a pointer).</p>",,0,1,,2009. 8. 25 오후 5:41:43,1,2009. 9. 6 오후 8:10:22,2009. 8. 25 오후 6:27:30,,73299,,73299,,1,2,c++|templates|sfinae|member-functions,3963

275229,What is source code control for?,"<p>There was a recent question about, effectively, replacing a local source code control system with a ""keep all versions"" file system or tool.</p>

<p>Many of the answers said in essence that source code control systems are for more than just keeping past versions, even for an individual developer - something I think is correct.</p>

<p>So, the question: What reasons are there for having source code control? And which of those are the most important?</p>

<p>I'm not so much interested in source code control features, but the reasons why those features are there. </p>

<p>Here's a starter for ten, but I'd like to know if I've missed some:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keeping all versions, especially ones that formed a shipped product</li>
<li>Enabling a team to edit and preventing (or at least alerting) when two attempt clashing changes</li>
<li>Making it easy to see differences between file versions (covering the top two developer excuses: ""I didn't change anything"" and ""my change shouldn't have done that"")</li>
<li>Protecting against developer accidents (deleting/changing code unintentionally)</li>
<li>Protecting against hardware problems (failed disks etc)</li>
<li>Allowing development of several different code bases while minimising duplication of unchanged files.</li>
<li>Keeping a record of who changed something, and why</li>
<li>Enabling experimental changes without breaking the main code base</li>

352641,Troubleshooting: Assembly resolution for a managed dll from a MS-Word VSTO Add-in,"<p>I have an MS-Word VSTO Document with a code-behind dll named <code>WordDocument1.dll</code></p>

<p><strong>Project folder D:\Work\Seven\WordAutomation\ContentControls\WordDocument1\bin\Debug</strong><br>
I've copied some custom code into a <code>MyAppExecs</code> folder under that. The DLL has a private bin path specified so that code in <code>MyAppExecs</code> is reachable.</p>

<p>So on startup, I load a <code>Starter.DLL</code> in the <code>MyAppExecs</code> folder which should popup a dialog, which it does. However clicking on a button on the dialog, needs to load <code>X.DLL</code>, which has unmanaged dependencies. (<code>X.DLL</code> has some managed C++, has some libs specified as additional dependencies. X is unsigned and a private assembly, not in GAC)</p>

<p>X.DLL, however, cannot be resolved. From the <code>fuslogvw</code> tool, I see that it is attempting to <strong>load this DLL in the Office12 folder and failing</strong>. I have <code>ProcMon</code> running too, however, it doesn't show any unmanaged dependency file not found errors. </p>

<ul>
<li>How do I make the Word Executable see the X.Dll which is present in <code>D: \Work\Seven\WordAutomation\ContentControls\WordDocument1\bin\Debug</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, it seems strange that it can load <code>Starter.DLL</code> and a ton of others without any problems in the <code>{ProjFolder}\MyAppExecs</code> but can't see files in <code>{ProjFolder}</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>fuslogvw</code> output:</p>

<p><strong>Update#1</strong>: Solved the symptom but couldn't identify the cause of the problem. 
I loaded the assembly manually via an Assembly.load. However, the above assembly resolution error kept being logged and it didn't work. 
Finally, in a fit of desperation, I copied my word-project DLLs into <code>{ProjFolder}\MyAppExecs</code> such that all the DLLs were in one folder and it started working.</p>

<p>It looks like some unmanaged dependencies of <code>X.dll</code> are not being resolved when I run from the <code>{ProjFolder}...</code> however, <code>ProcMon</code> doesn't show any sign of that. Also updated the PATH variable to include <code>{ProjFolder}\MyAppExecs</code>, but no luck.</p>

489401,Visual Studio Database Pro Partial Projects Constraints Issue,"<p>In Visual Studio 2008 Database edition one can use ""partial projects"" to allow a database to be separated into multiple projects for deployment and maintainability. I have been looking into doing this with our project but hit the following snag: </p>

<p>If you have project that defines some base tables, and then you have a different project that defines a new set of tables that have constraints pointing to the tables in the first project, DBPro seems unable to map this relationship. The specific error is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""CONSTRAINT has an unresolved reference to Table foo"" (where foo is in the original DB).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more concrete example if you'd like to duplicate for yourself the scenario: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a Project called BaseDB. </p></li>
<li><p>Define in BaseDB a table called Users with the following DDL: </p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Users] ( 
    UserID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, 
    UserName NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Export BaseDB as a partial project adding the _BaseDB.files file to your project. </p></li>
<li><p>Create a Project in the same solution called DerivedDB</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Import Partial Project to point to BaseDB, confirming if you like that there's a stub reference in your import files pointing to the Users table in BaseDB.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a table in DerivedDB called PowerUsers with the following DDL: </p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PowerUsers] ( 
    PowerUserID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, 
    UserID INT NOT NULL
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you do a ""Build"" at this point, everything works.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT in the DerivedDB project from PowerUsers to Users with the following DDL:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>ALTER TABLE [dbo].[PowerUsers]
    ADD CONSTRAINT [PowerUsers_Users_FK]
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID)

<p>Performing the above steps should allow you to see the error I'm talking about.</p>

<p>It appears that only option is to ""subclass"" GControl to create a custom control. I have 3 questions</p>

<p>1) First of all, is GControl subclassing the best course of action?</p>

<p>2) In my example, the canvas (div) where map renders can change its size (i.e is not fixed width). Do I have to delete and add custom control when canvas changes size? See docs <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/controls.html#Custom_Controls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/controls.html#Custom_Controls</a> on how to create a custom map control.</p>

<p>3) Now, how to do it. Naively, I thought I could create a table with 3 columns and 3 rows, and set display: none for the cell in the middle. But that doesn't work. I've also experimented with clipping, that didn't work either. My css skills are quite lacking, so there must be way to do this more elegantly than adding four rectangular gray divs. If I wanted to add an inner border, with divs, I would need to paint 8 then. In a nutshell, what's the best way to create a ""hollow"" rectangle?</p>

645870,VS2008 setup project installing extra dependency files,"<p>In <code>VS2008</code> I have a setup project which installs the Primary Output of one app to the application folder, and the <code>Primary Output</code> of class library project into a subfolder of the application directory.</p>

<p>Both projects reference several third-party assemblies (some <code>DevExpress</code> <strong>UI</strong> controls).</p>

<p>When I install the application, the subfolder is successfully created and the class library assembly is correctly put there.  However, all the third-party assemblies are duplicated to this folder as well (they are in the main application folder <em>and</em> the subfolder).</p>

<p>One other completely bizarre behavior (IMO) is that if I delete the extra assemblies manually from the subfolder, then I run the executable in the app folder, the deleted assemblies get copied to the subfolder again.</p>

<p>I then modified the setup project to only install the class library assembly from its Debug folder (as opposed to the <code>Primary Output</code>).  When I install the app the <code>DevExpress</code> DLLs are <em>still</em> going to both folders.  (However, if I delete the extra assemblies and run the executable the extra dependencies do not reappear this time.)</p>

<p>There are many interviews, both for developers and qa, where you are asked to test smth out. A classic is to <strong>test the save dialog from notepad</strong>. </p>

<p>Here is a list of tests I can come up with, categorized and prioritized: </p>

<p>[functional, high] - dialog performs its use cases - comes up when the user does a ""save as"", the buttons on the left work, the file is saved with the given name and encoding, top buttons work, cancel button works.</p>

<hr>

<p>[functional, medium] - save to a Read Only medium - does a fair error pop up?</p>

<p>[functional, medium] - save an empty file</p>

<p>[functional, low] - save a file as .txt but delete the extension from the name</p>

<p>[functional, high] - make sure the dialog is modal</p>

<p>[functional, high] - make sure the dir navigation &amp; dir features work</p>

<p>[functional, high] - context menu options work</p>

<hr>

<p>[load, low] - navigate to a directory where there are a very large (aproaching the system limit) number of .txt files; save the file there</p>

<p>[load, low] - navigate to a directory with a large number of sub-directories. save the file there.</p>

<hr>

<p>[stress, low] - navigate to a directory with a maximum number of files allowed and try to save the file</p>

<p>[stress, low] - saturate the system with file handles (to simulate apps that have very rich interfaces or handle leaks, like Yahoo Messenger); does the dialog pop ?</p>

<p>[stress, medium] - try to save a files when there isn't space on the disk.</p>

<p>[stress, low] - check how deep the ""navigate to last folder"" button goes with this</p>

<p>[stress, low] - navigate to a directory with a very large number of directories</p>

<hr>

<p>[performance, low] - measure the time needed to display the dialog </p>

<p>[performance, low] - measure the resources used by the dialog (memory, window handles, I/O); make sure the resources are dealocated</p>

<hr>

<p>[accessibility, high] - is the dialog compatible with the accesability tools win provides? (magnifier, narrator); for example that the menu items scale well when choosing large fonts</p>

<p>[accessibility &amp; compatibility, medium] - is the dialog compatible with famous 3rd party programs that provide accessibility features?</p>

<hr>

<p>[localization, high] - the dialog works on other locales</p>

<p>[localization, high] - random inputs of UTF-8 and ANSII letters as the file name</p>

<p>[localization, medium] - right to left locales</p>

<hr>

<p>[compatibility] - make sure that the file saved can be opened by other editing tools, no matter what the encoding is</p>

<hr>

<p>[usability, high] - user is asked if he is sure he wants to overwrite a file</p>

If the user is running on a virtual machine and hits F1 in one of the modal popups then the help keyword doesn't get passed to the help handler, which means they get the top level help topic instead of the correct context sensitive stuff.</p>

<p>I am using an AJAX ModalPopupExtender to initiate an Ajax request.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to try and hide the ModalPopupExtender by adding exception handling into the calling method, calling hide() on the ModalPopupExtender and then re-throwing the exception so that the execption is caught and displayed as an alert to the user. This didn't work.</p>

1178885,Update EntityKey Reference in Entity Framework,"<p>I created an application that uses Asp.net, Entity Framework and Windows Workflow Foundation and everything works as expected. </p>

<p>My asp.net page should start a Workflow that executes and update an entity passed to the workflow from the page. Everything works ok: i used Unit Of Work pattern to share the context between asp.net and WWF and my entity is successfully updated during the workflow... except a field that is modelled in my entity as a reference to another entity. </p>

<p>Suppose this case. The main entity is called Item that has a property called Status that is a foreign key to another entity called Status. When i create an Item, i just create it with the common syntax like </p>

<pre><code>Item i = new Item();
</code></pre>

<p>I then create the reference to Status entity like this:</p>

<pre><code>i.StatusReference.EntityKey = new System.Data.EntityKey(""myEntities.StatusSet"", ""idStatus"", State);
</code></pre>

<p>where State is an integer value hardcoded in the Workflow step. </p>

<p>Whenever I try to update this Entity (the Item one) i follow these steps:
a) I retrieve the Entity from the context (a new one, built as Unit Of Work for the following transaction) using:</p>

<pre><code>Item i = (from item in ctx.ItemsSet where item.idItem == itemID select item).FirstOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>Entity is then attached to my context. EntityState is in UNCHANGED</p>

<p>b) I update the Status reference like before:</p>

<pre><code>i.StatusReference.EntityKey = new System.Data.EntityKey(""myEntities.StatusSet"", ""idStatus"", State);
</code></pre>

<p>c) I save changes on the context like:
ctx.SaveChanges();</p>

<p>Using vs2008 debugger i can see the updated entity and when changes are saved... i see all properties changed (modifiedDate, itemName and other props) but entity reference still points at the original one.</p>

1294814,Linq to Sql Add Child records,"<p>I have two entities in Linq to Sql setup as a Parent/Child relationship (Parent can have many Children).  I have an existing parent record and trying to create new child records to be ""added"" to the parent.  Let's use the familiar Order and OrderDetails model for explanation.</p>

<p>I am trying a bunch of things to add my ""child"" to the parent record, but when I call SubmitChanges() on the data context, my newly created data is not ""inserted"" to the database.</p>

<p>For example, I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>MyDataContext context = new MyDataContext();
Order existingOrder = context.Orders.SingleOrDefault(o =&gt; p.OrderID == orderID);
OrderDetail newDetail = new OrderDetail();
//fill in order details here...

//ESTABLISH THE LINK SUCH THAT NEW RECORD IS CREATED
existingOrder.OrderDetails.Add(newDetail);

context.SubmitChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried:</p>

<pre><code>MyDataContext context = new MyDataContext();
Order existingOrder = context.Orders.SingleOrDefault(o =&gt; p.OrderID == orderID);
OrderDetail newDetail = new OrderDetail();
//fill in order details here...

//ESTABLISH THE LINK SUCH THAT NEW RECORD IS CREATED
newDetail.OrderID = existingOrder.OrderID;
newDetail.Order = existingOrder;

context.SubmitChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>And a combination of the two:</p>

<pre><code>MyDataContext context = new MyDataContext();
Order existingOrder = context.Orders.SingleOrDefault(o =&gt; p.OrderID == orderID);
OrderDetail newDetail = new OrderDetail();
//fill in order details here...

//ESTABLISH THE LINK SUCH THAT NEW RECORD IS CREATED
newDetail.OrderID = existingOrder.OrderID;
newDetail.Order = existingOrder;
existingOrder.OrderDetails.Add(newDetail);

context.SubmitChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>The wierd thing is that both of these ways of handling things appear to be working on other places of the code base.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>MyEntity myEntity = context.MyEntities.SingleOrDefault(e =&gt; e.MyEntityID = id);
myEntity.SelectedCategories.Add( 
    new SelectedCategory { MyEntityID = myEntity.MyEntityID , CategoryID = categoryId } 
);
context.SubmitChanges(); //correctly adds the new ""many-to-many"" record
</code></pre>

<p>What is the ""Correct"" way to do what I am attempting to do?  Do I need to explicitly call InsertOnSubmit() for each new item I am creating?  Is there now way to tell the model that anything added to the child collection should be added on submit?</p>

1332707,How to partition client sensitive data using Microsoft Sync Framework (v2 CTP 2)?,"<p>Our central database is to be synchronized in a hub &amp; spoke fashion.</p>

<p>We need to be able to partition the data in a way that client data is replicated locally only to that client.</p>

<p>Has anyone faced this problem?</p>

<p>MSF provides sync scopes - declarations of tables are to be sycned, with the option to specify a filtercolumn and filter clause,  however there doesn't seem to be a way to pass a parameter (say clientID) to the filter.</p>

<p>Here's and example from the msdn documentation:</p>

<pre><code>        ' Create a scope named ""filtered_customer"", and add two tables to the scope. 
        ' GetDescriptionForTable gets the schema of each table, so that tracking 
        ' tables and triggers can be created for that table. 
        Dim scopeDesc As New DbSyncScopeDescription(""filtered_customer"")

        scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable(""Customer"", serverConn))
        scopeDesc.Tables.Add(SqlSyncDescriptionBuilder.GetDescriptionForTable(""CustomerContact"", serverConn))

        ' Create a provisioning object for ""filtered_customer"" and specify that 
        ' base tables should not be created (They already exist in SyncSamplesDb_SqlPeer1). 
        Dim serverConfig As New SqlSyncScopeProvisioning(scopeDesc)
        serverConfig.CreateTableDefault = DbSyncCreationOption.Skip

        ' Specify which column(s) in the Customer table to use for filtering data, 
        ' and the filtering clause to use against the tracking table. 
        ' ""[side]"" is an alias for the tracking table. 
        serverConfig(""Customer"").AddFilterColumn(""CustomerType"")
        serverConfig(""Customer"").FilterClause = ""[side].[CustomerType] = 'Retail'""

        ' Configure the scope and change tracking infrastructure. 
        serverConfig.Apply(serverConn)
</code></pre>

<p>Our problem is that we need to the filter to except a clientID as a runtime parameter.</p>

<p>Is this supported in the MSF?</p>

<p>If not perhaps this can this be achieved by declaring multiple scopes - declare a scope per client with the filterclause specifying the clientID.  This would require the server to be re-provisioned every time we create a new client.... right?</p>

<p>Does anyone know if the SqlSyncScopeProvisioning class can be used to add a new scope to a database that has already been provisioned with an existing scope?</p>

<p>Seemingly the MSF has been designed to support multiple scopes, it's not clear to me how the SqlSyncScopeProvisioning class is used to add additional scopes.</p>",,0,0,,2009. 8. 26 오전 6:30:21,5,2011. 4. 3 오후 2:39:20,2011. 4. 3 오후 2:39:20,,1288,,3966,,1,3,distributed|microsoft-sync-framework|database-partitioning,637

202951,Microsoft Async RPC crash in Vista,"<p>I am working on a program that makes RPC calls where the client and the server are running on the same machine.

324146,WPF VisualBrush with mixed aspect ratio,"<p>We are using the Mindfusion WPF Diagramming Component.  I require a Visualbrush which must be able to be used in a third-party component for diagramming.</p>

<p>We have horizontally-stretching lanes on the diagramming canvas. We must define a background color for this lane, and some text on the top-left corner, to be repeated on the x-axis.  The text must remain the same size while the rest of the lane is filled with color when the lane is re-sized.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only thing we can do is provide a Visualbrush to the diagramming component, which is then set as background for the lane.  It seems impossible to work with this restriction because I am unable to define a text with fixed size, repeating on the x-axis, while also having a color brush stretching, all within a single Visualbrush.  How can this be done?</p>",,0,1,,2008. 11. 27 오후 4:20:17,,2013. 2. 28 오후 9:21:09,2013. 2. 28 오후 9:21:09,,985906,Alex Maker,41407,,1,4,wpf|diagramming|visualbrush,876
