8,70252391,"Query to get all records, which have children, but only for which the user has permission to all children?","Let say you have a set of tables like this, where you have  which can be associated with multiple <code>Account</code> strings, and <code>Users</code> which can be permissioned to multiple <code>Account</code> strings. Now what we want to do is write a query that will return all <code>Warnings</code> for a <code>User</code>, but the <code>User</code> must have a <code>UserAccountPerms</code> for every <code>Account</code> associated with the user.

One idea we've had is to add a column <code>account_count</code> to the <code>Warnings</code> table and then you would have to run two queries, one which gets for each warning the count of accounts that the user has access to, and then joins that back to the <code>Warnings</code> table to see if the count is the same. Something like:
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Warnings w
JOIN
(
    SELECT warning_id, IFNULL(COUNT(*),0) AS acct_perm_count
    FROM WarningAccounts wa LEFT JOIN UserAccountPerms uap ON wa.account_name = uap.account_name
    WHERE uap.user_id = X
    GROUP BY wa.warning_id
) wp ON w.warning_id = wp.warning_id
WHERE w.account_count = acct_perm_count
</code></pre>
The biggest issue with this, is that as the tables get large, and you want to filter the <code>Warnings</code> by other columns, you end up having to copy the predicate into both parts of the statement, i.e.
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Warnings w
JOIN
(
    SELECT warning_id, IFNULL(COUNT(*),0) AS acct_perm_count
    FROM Warnings w1 JOIN WarningAccounts wa ON w1.warning_id = wa.warning_id
    LEFT JOIN UserAccountPerms uap ON wa.account_name = uap.account_name
    WHERE 
      uap.user_id = X AND
      w1.start_time &gt; @start_time
    GROUP BY wa.warning_id
) wp ON w.warning_id = wp.warning_id
WHERE w.account_count = acct_perm_count AND
w.start_time &gt; @start_time;
</code></pre>
Because if you don't, it means you are always calculating the permissions for every single <code>Warning</code> all of the time. Any thoughts on how to do this?",mysql

This is amazing, But if I want to include an additional column for a particular range of Dates, it does not work. Here is the following query I have attempted.
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `Schema`.`Table` WHERE (`ID`,`Code`,`Date`) 
IN ((1,'AE', BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-03'),(2,'AD',BETWEEN '2021-01-02' AND '2021-01-04'));
</code></pre>
I could use Union ALL to merge the unique Data on the <code>ID</code> and <code>Code</code> and have the separate Date Range. But I am just wondering if my approach for the syntax is wrong, or even if there is a better way to approach this.

Since I have a huge database and some sensors stopped writing data 2 weeks ago, from time to time I check the <code>MAX(datetime)</code> for each location to see which one sent the last time the data.
Now my question is, can I expand my sql query to also include the max time for each location?

And then I have a table where I record the last crawl operations I made.
The idea is having a script that can restart crawling everyday without recrawling companies that have been done.
Crawl_Settings
<div class=""s-table-container"">
<table class=""s-table"">

<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AMZN</td>
<td>NASDAQ</td>
<td>12/11/2021</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
I thought about making a query that would get me all the companies that have a last crawl date that is not today.

I think that this query will work, but won't get me the  companies that have never been crawled.
Expected result:
<div class=""s-table-container"">
<table class=""s-table"">

128,70148848,How to select full month calendar with attendance condition in MySQL?,"Good day! I tried searching this problem all over stack overflow but I cant find the right keyword to search, I guess its better to ask you guys for help.
I am trying to create an attendance history that is base on two tables:
<ol>
<li>attendance table</li>
<li>calendar_dimension table</li>
</ol>
attendance table has data like below

and calendar_dimension is just a basic table with dates, like so:
Please note that is a full month calendar:
<pre><code>|    date     |   datestatus  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2021-11- 1  to  2021-11-25  |
| 2021-11-26  |   Holiday     |
| 2021-11-27  |               |
| 2021-11-28  |               |
| 2021-11-29  |               |
| 2021-11-30  |               |
</code></pre>
What I have done so far is by joing calendar_dimension and attendance table.
Now, I have something like this: e.g. for 00001, which is working on my end:
<pre><code>|  idnumber   |   punchin   |   punhout   |  date_created  |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-29   |
</code></pre>
And for 0002:
<pre><code>|  idnumber   |   punchin   |   punhout   |  date_created  |   Status   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+------------+
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-27   |  Present   |
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-28   |  Present   |
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-29   |  Present   |
</code></pre>
I want my history table looks like this by employee:
<pre><code>|  idnumber   |   punchin   |   punhout   |  date_created  |   Status   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+------------+
|                      2021-11-1 to 2021-11-25                          |
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-26   |  Holiday   |
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-27   |  Absent    |
|   0001      |    7:30:00  |   16:00:00  |   2021-11-28   |  Absent    |

143,70060538,Will importing a database mysqldump that excludes a table from source preserve the table in destination?,"Moving a database () from one server to the next and there was one table (<code>big_table</code>) that was so large it took longer to import into the destination than our preferred maintenance window so we kept the application communicating with the source database server while the destination continued to import.
Now we want to redo the process to get what has changed in two steps:
<ol>
<li>dump all tables from source except the <code>big_table</code> and make sure we don't overwrite or drop the very large table already in the destination when we import</li>
<li>dump the new/updated records from the <code>big_table</code> since the last timestamp and import those delta records into the existing destination <code>db.big_table</code></li>
</ol>
For the first step, will this work to preserve <code>db1</code> and <code>db.big_table</code> in the destination while recreating all other tables?
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>mysqldump -h host1 db1 --ignore-table=db1.big_table --no-create-db | mysql -h host2 db1

I am trying to understand if each of these &quot;patch&quot; attempts of changes in source since the first import into destination doesn't try to drop/create <code>db1</code> or <code>db1.big_table</code> but instead just captures and imports all tables except <code>big_table</code> and only new records in <code>big_table</code> since a known timestamp.

146,70314877,BigQuery user-defined function in JavaScript does not prune partitions,"I have a BigQuery table that I'd like to partition by low-cardinality string column. That's not possible, so I have to hash strings into integer and partition by integer. I made a very naive hashing algorithm that converts those strings into integers between 0 and 100.
So far so good, I made a new table partitioned by this new integer field which is simply a function of another field. Now I can query this table by partitioned integer field and greatly reduce traffic. Cool! But I really want to query by the string field, so I made a user-defined function that basically does the hashing so I can write queries like this:

Which is essentially the same as this, but more performant:
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `partitioned_table` WHERE unpartitioned_string_field = &quot;abc&quot;
</code></pre>
Now the problem is, if I create user-defined function <code>HashOf</code> as SQL (just naive case-when, for example) it works just fine, the traffic reduces as expected. However, if I create the function as JavaScript (which is preferable here), then it has no effect on the traffic. The query works, but requires full table scan. Both SQL and JavaScript versions return exactly the same result, but JavaScript version doesn't prune partitions it seems like.
Am I missing something? Why JavaScript user-defined function does not prune partitions even though it returns the correct integer value for partitioned field?",google-bigquery

148,70036765,How to keep objects in node Neo4j,"I have array of objects with this structure

I am trying to find the best way to keep it in neo4j node. Since later I am going to search, filter ... on this data I don't want to keep hole object as string. Creating property by name object.name is not possible because I have punctuation marks. The ideal way would be to keep it as property, because I am going to use this data as property of node, but removing punctuation marks from name is not an option too.
Probably I could keep them in array
<pre><code>['here is the name', ' and the second element of array is the text']
</code></pre>
In this case the problem will be to give correct name to the property, which will have this array.
Another option could be to keep all data in list like this
<pre><code>tabs: ['first name - first value', ' second name - second value']
</code></pre>
but to search later I will need to use regex inside the list. this doesn't seem flexible.
So what would be the best way ?

If possible, I would only like to have one column in the query result that contains those specific dates.

188,70217516,SQL to SELECT all groups belonging to a specific member ID AND all the users that belong to each group,"I have three tables, the relevant parts of which are:
users

groups
<pre><code>groups.groupID, groups.groupOwner, groups.groupName
</code></pre>
mapFriendsGroups
<pre><code>mapFriendsGroups.userID, mapFriendsGroups.groupID
</code></pre>
To be clear, the functionality is that a primary user can create new groups which appear in the groups table.  A primary user has a list of friends (secondary users, each with their own entry in the users table) that they can add to one of their groups; this is represented by that friend's users.userID value being entered into the mapFriendsGroups.userID field of the mapFriendsGroups table. I then wrote this SQL to get the data that I want to display:
<pre><code> SELECT `groups`.*, `users`.* FROM `groups` JOIN `mapFriendsGroups` ON `groups`.`groupID` = `mapFriendsGroups`.`groupID` JOIN `users` ON `users`.`userID` = `mapFriendsGroups`.`userID` WHERE `groups`.`groupOwner` = ? ORDER BY `groups`.`groupID`, `users`.`userLastName`
</code></pre>
I handle this as a prepared statement in PHP and bind the primary user's users.userID value (which is held in a session variable) to the ?
This very nearly works but I discovered one problem - if a primary user creates a group but has not assigned any members to that group, the group will not be part of the results. I am convinced I'm doing a JOIN wrong but can't seem to get it to work.
I checked several other questions on stackoverflow (e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14983042/select-all-users-that-belong-to-a-certain-group-complicated-query"">Select all users that belong to a certain group, complicated query</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66693042/sql-query-get-all-users-for-a-specific-group-and-each-user-with-all-groups"">SQL: query get all users for a specific group and each user with all groups</a> ) but all of those answers seem to assume that the groups are not restricted to a subset and filtered by the current user's ID.
Anyone have any suggestions?
In case it matters, here's what I'm using to parse the data after I get it:
<pre><code>if ($r-&gt;num_rows &gt; 0) { // If it ran OK.
    $data1 = $r-&gt;fetch_assoc(); 
    $myGroups = '';
    $currentGroup = '';
    do {  
        // check the value of the current group variable against the actual current group name
        if ($currentGroup == $data1['groupName']){
            // this is part of a prior group...
            $myGroups .= ', '.$data1['userFirstName'].' '.$data1['userLastName'];
        } else {
            // this is not part of a prior group. check if the current group variable is empty - if it is then just start a new row
            if ($currentGroup == ''){
                $myGroups .= '&lt;tr&gt;';
                $myGroups .= '&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'.$data1['groupName'].'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';

            } else {
                // close the prior group then start a new row
                $myGroups .= '&lt;/td&gt;';
                $myGroups .= '&lt;/tr&gt;';

It ain't pretty, but it outputs a table of data where the users sees all of his groups (that have members in them) and who are the members (note that the creator of a group is NOT part of the group - this is important for later functionality).  Again, I just need a tweak that will let this show empty groups. It's not an error in the PHP code - I've tested the SQL directly in phpMyAdmin's SQL tool and even there I'm not seeing the groups with zero members.
I wish I could just add the creator of the group to the group - that would enable my current code to do the job - but again that's not an option for this project.
<em><strong><strong>EDIT 01</strong></strong></em>
Here's a sample of the data:
from the users table
userID = 5 is the primary user (the value of ? in the test query)
other userID values are 1,2,3,4,8,10,11,12
from the groups table, only those groups whose groups.groupOwner value = 5
<pre><code>groupID = 11 | groupName = BFFs
groupID = 12 | groupName = Car
groupID = 13 | groupName = Shopping
groupID = 14 | groupName = Travel
groupID = 15 | groupName = Test
groupID = 18 | groupName = Gamers
</code></pre>
from the mapFriendsGroups table, the relevant rows
<pre><code>userID = 1 | groupID 11
userID = 2 | groupID 11
userID = 3 | groupID 11
userID = 1 | groupID 12
userID = 2 | groupID 13
userID = 3 | groupID 13
userID = 1 | groupID 14
userID = 3 | groupID 14
userID = 1 | groupID 15
userID = 2 | groupID 15
</code></pre>
<em><strong><strong>EDIT 02</strong></strong></em>
I took the csv export option from phpMySQL and dumped it into a text editor, removed the irrelevant columns, and am pasting it here. Note there's 10 rows.
<pre><code>11,5,BFFs,3,Alex,Smith
11,5,BFFs,2,Ben,Smith
11,5,BFFs,1,Allison,Smith
12,5,Car,1,Allison,Smith
13,5,Shopping,3,Alex,Smith

14,5,Travel,3,Alex,Smith
14,5,Travel,1,Allison,Smith
15,5,Test,2,Ben,Smith
15,5,Test,1,Allison,Smith
</code></pre>
I'm trying to get this same type of output, but with an 11th row that would be:
<pre><code>18,5,Gamers,,,
</code></pre>
That is, the group that has no members in it.
<em><strong><strong>EDIT 03 - FINAL EDIT</strong></strong></em>
I've got it working. The trick seems to be to make both of the joins into LEFT JOIN - that gives me the needed output of 11 rows, i.e. 10 rows with associated members of a group and 1 row for a group that has no members (and which has null values for the fields of userID and userName so I'll need to handle that in the PHP code that parses it... but that's trivial).
Thank you very much to all of you that contributed. I will mark as the correct answer the contribution which helped me the most to find the correct answer.",mysql

<strong>STEP 5</strong> Repeat step 4 until some condition is met i(e perform x iterations, or you have reached the end of each path).
<em><strong>Okay so here is where I am stuck.</strong></em> I've looked into a few potential options, Recursive CTE, recursive function call, function call in a while loop, or maybe just repeating this query in a while loop.
I'm not sure which of these if any would allow me to do what I want:
<ol>
<li>The recursive CTE I'm not sure would work since it relies on union and it seems to not be possible to implement with left join. I did find some tree traversal examples, but in each case it was limited to starting with a single edge, I'm assuming that is a limitation of that method since union expands the number of rows not the number of columns. I need a method that allows me to traverse multiple edges like what I've started to do here. When I eventually get this working I will port this to our actual database which probably has 100,000-1,000,000 of these edges
</li>
<li>The functional call options seem tricky because it seems like you can't pass a table to a function (but you can pass a table like thing or something but still I haven't been able to figure that out)
</li>
<li>I like the idea of just repeating this query in a while loop but I haven't been able to find understandable documentation on how to do a while loop in a PostgreSQL query. I haven't been able to implement even a basic while loop in a query on SQL fiddle.

<strong>STEP 5</strong> Repeat step 4 until some condition is met i(e perform x iterations, or you have reached the end of each path).
<em><strong>Okay so here is where I am stuck.</strong></em> I've looked into a few potential options, Recursive CTE, recursive function call, function call in a while loop, or maybe just repeating this query in a while loop.
I'm not sure which of these if any would allow me to do what I want:
<ol>
<li>The recursive CTE I'm not sure would work since it relies on union and it seems to not be possible to implement with left join. I did find some tree traversal examples, but in each case it was limited to starting with a single edge, I'm assuming that is a limitation of that method since union expands the number of rows not the number of columns. I need a method that allows me to traverse multiple edges like what I've started to do here. When I eventually get this working I will port this to our actual database which probably has 100,000-1,000,000 of these edges
</li>
<li>The functional call options seem tricky because it seems like you can't pass a table to a function (but you can pass a table like thing or something but still I haven't been able to figure that out)
</li>
<li>I like the idea of just repeating this query in a while loop but I haven't been able to find understandable documentation on how to do a while loop in a PostgreSQL query. I haven't been able to implement even a basic while loop in a query on SQL fiddle.

Solutions taken:
Create a logs id of each transaction id and load it in the form so that when the user adds an item the system will log that the new item entered by John will be a new transaction. But what if some technical error happens like Johns computer freezes, and the transaction is not saved and Mary took the id that was supposed to be Johns.

So to sum it up:
John had made a (first)transaction  with a total price of : 15.00
My problem is that what if I want to create another transaction but the system will just add up the last transaction I made.
Solutions taken:
Create a logs id of each transaction id and load it in the form so that when the user adds an item the system will log that the new item entered by John will be a new transaction. But what if some technical error happens like Johns computer freezes, and the transaction is not saved and Mary took the id that was supposed to be Johns. My main problem here is how to make my data reliable and accurate when keeping records. I hope someone helps mehaving trouble designing my web app database.
I want to save every item the user will input but each item must be registered to a transaction id.
It is possible to do this on a single user only but when there are multiple users, the items are jumbled.

261,70190562,Postgresql - Update Query - How To Set Column Value To Be The Name Of The Last Column That Is Not null,"I have some data similar to that listed below:

The column <em>rejected_at_stage</em> is a new column that is to be backfilled to set the name of the stages column (stage1...stage5) that is the last instance (left to right) that is not null. For example, in row 2 the rejected_at_stage value is stage2. This is because stage1 is not null and stage2 is not null. However, stage3 has a null value. So the <em>rejected_at_stage</em> column = last non null value from stages columns (left to right) =&gt; stage 2.
Is it possible to do the following in postgresql to update the rejected_at_stage column for each row in a select statement?
<ul>
<li>find the last column that is not null from the given set of columns (e.g.[stage1, stage2...., stage5]</li>
<li>Update the rejected_at_stage column with the name of the column that was found</li>
</ul>",postgresql

Logically, I'd think you can pass a list of values to SQL to filter based on columns, but it doesn't seem to work.
My code is below:

However, that returns syntax error messages.
My though process was that since I can query by saying <code>WHERE column_1 = value_in_column_1</code>, I should be able to add additional values to it, but it seems it's not the case.

264,70219277,MySQL: Getting a row from another table that has a column value over the current one,"Apologies for the weird title phrasing, but I honestly don't know how to explain this any better. The query in itself with the context might be clearer, though:

I have log entries that have tiers depending on their value. So for instance, a log entry could have a value of 50 and have Tier 1 which is for values over 25. I could have Tier 2 which is 100, so as long as a value is between 50 and 100, it'll be Tier 1... You get the idea.<br />
So basically, the idea here is that I have a trigger that's being run when a new tier is being inserted. As you can see in the query above, I want to update the existing log entries with the new tier that's being added. I have no issues updating all the entries whose values are over the newly added tier's threshold, however, I do not know how to prevent entries that are above the next existing tier from being updated (because they're not included in the [new tier; next tier] interval). The &quot;1000&quot; that I wrote in the query is what should be the value of the next tier, and I just don't know how to retrieve that.<br />

I want to compare the <code>quantity</code> per <code>product</code> and <code>inbound_type</code> in two different <code>data_sources</code>.
I was able to come close to the result with this query:
<pre><code>SELECT
    i.data_source AS date_source,
    i.product AS product,
    i.inbound_type AS inbound_type,
    (CASE WHEN i.data_source = 'data_source_01' THEN SUM(i.quantity) ELSE 0 END) AS quantity_data_source_01,
    (CASE WHEN i.data_source = 'data_source_02' THEN SUM(i.quantity) ELSE 0 END) AS quantity_data_source_02
FROM 
    check_inbound i
GROUP BY 
    1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 2,1
</code></pre>
However, I could not figure out how I can get rid of the rows with the zero values and put the quantities on the same line as in the expected result.
Do you have any idea what I need to change to make it work?",sql|postgresql

<code>created_at</code> is reduced to hours and you need to count how many records satisfy the condition &lt;= <code>created_at_by_hour</code>. But the grouping should be such that if the time (hour) when no records were created, then just duplicate the previous hour.
The table consists of three fields - <code>id</code> (int), <code>direction_id</code> (int), <code>created_at</code> (timestamptz). I need to get an hourly (based on the created_at field) data upload with the number of records created before this &quot;grouped&quot; time.

If no records were created for a certain <code>direction_id</code> at a certain hour, duplicate the previous one, but the result should end at the last <code>created_at</code>. <code>created_at</code> is the time when the record was created is a table:

1 and 2 in the header are all possible values of  that are in the table.
<code>created_at</code> is reduced to hours and you need to count how many records satisfy the condition &lt;= <code>created_at_by_hour</code>. But the grouping should be such that if the time (hour) when no records were created, then just duplicate the previous hour.
The table consists of three fields - <code>id</code> (int), <code>direction_id</code> (int), <code>created_at</code> (timestamptz). I need to get an hourly (based on the created_at field) data upload with the number of records created before this &quot;grouped&quot; time. But I need not just the number, but separately for each <code>direction_id</code> (there are only two of them - <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>). If no records were created for a certain <code>direction_id</code> at a certain hour, duplicate the previous one, but the result should end at the last <code>created_at</code>. <code>created_at</code> is the time when the record was created.",sql|postgresql

320,70147596,Get all of the low-level children of a node,"I am struggling with the writing of a query for PostgreSQL. The table resembles a tree and every item can have <em>n</em> children.
I would like to get only and all the children of the lowest level(s) (which don't have any children by themselves) of a given element of the tree.
The structure:

Some values of the table would look like this:
<pre><code> 1  &quot;Products&quot;  NULL --Parent
 2  &quot;Metal&quot; 1
 3  &quot;Nails&quot; 2
 4  &quot;Chains&quot;    2
 5  &quot;Bicycle Chains&quot;    4
 6  &quot;Shimano Bicycle Chains&quot;    5
 7  &quot;Shimano Bicycle Chains&quot;    5
 8  &quot;7mm chain, black&quot;    4
 9  &quot;Wood&quot;  1
 10 &quot;Cutting Boards&quot;    8
 11 &quot;Cutting Board Holder&quot; 8
</code></pre>
Most of the solutions on SO deal with not very deep trees which have just 1-2 levels. Or it is known from which parent the children are required.
I would like to select all children of &quot;Chains&quot; (4), which would give the following result:
<pre><code>6   &quot;Shimano Bicycle Chains&quot;    5
7   &quot;Shimano Bicycle Chains&quot;    5
8   &quot;7mm chain, black&quot;    4
</code></pre>
To be honest, recursive queries are not my strongest skill. I had the idea already to search upside down - getting all items first which are never used as parents and then going down, but this only shifts the problem to the point again that I have to go down recursively from the given parent which seems a bit over the top.",sql|postgresql

Because someone could have gone on to the page the hour before but only made a comment later on.

Explanation: From the 'test' table, we can get the average report generation time of Hospital 'A' is 320 minutes since there are three records about Hospital 'A' (the doctors whose id are 1 and 2) and the average report generation time of Hospital 'B' is 1630 / 3 minutes since there are three records about Hospital 'B' (the doctors whose id are 3 and 4) and the average report generation time of Hospital 'C' is 450 minutes since there are two records about Hospital 'C' (the doctors whose id are 5 and 6). As a result, the answer is Hospital 'A'.

Let me know if MYSQL allows users to specify name &amp; label to a given column.

358,70148035,What is the advantage of using BigQuery’s QUALIFY operator?,"I have just discovered BigQuery’s QUALIFY operator and have been reading about it at <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#qualify_clause"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#qualify_clause</a>
That documentation though does not explain why I should use QUALIFY instead of a normal WHERE predicate. If we take the example provided in the documentation:

That query could also be written as
<pre><code>SELECT
  item,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY purchases DESC) as rank
FROM Produce
WHERE Produce.category = 'vegetable'
AND rank &lt;= 3
</code></pre>
and it would produce the same result. So what is the advantage of using QUALIFY?",google-bigquery
359,70367729,Will a Postgres Serial Primary Key overwrite an existing primary key?,"I just created a new database and copied all of the data from another database into the new database. In one of the database tables titled 'users', there is a column titled 'user_id' that I have set to 'serial primary key', so it auto increments.

Currently, the lowest user_id number is 13 and the highest is 568. Before changing to the new database, the auto increment would continue past the highest number in the database. But now in the new database, it started the auto increment back at 1.

418,70035273,How to get rid of duplicate SQL results when aggregrating from 2 linking tables without using distinct,"My question is a performance question.
Given this postgresql, I get this result.

I can see that the <code>post</code> ending in <code>89</code> has 2 hashtags. All good so far.
I now modify the query to get the following expected result.
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>select fp.fp_id post_id, 
jsonb_agg(tag_linking_table.sehset_tid) hashtag
FROM soc_ent social_entity

All good so far. My hashtags are properly grouped. Now if i changed the query to get the <code>likes</code> count using the same method above, this is my expected result
<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>select fp.fp_id post_id, 
count(social_entity_likes.se_likes_ca) likes

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XZg3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XZg3.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a>
So in summary, my post ending in <code>89</code> has 2 likes from the <code>Likes</code> linking table, and 2 <code>Hashtags</code> from the hashtag linking table.
Now comes the problem. I want to display the hashtags and the likes in one sql query, so i modified the sql to the following.

LEFT JOIN se_likes social_entity_likes on social_entity.se_id = social_entity_likes.se_likes_seid 
GROUP BY post_id
</code></pre>
But oddly, my result was this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vlMG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vlMG.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a>

My approach is the following:

Which gives the following result:

  2 |   1 |           1 |  1

  4 |   1 |           1 |  1
  5 |   3 |           1 |  1
    |     |           2 |  2
  6 |   9 |           2 |  1
    |     |           7 |  2
(8 lignes)
</code></pre>
The code is pretty ugly and will only work for one split: I could very well have only one sale of qty=20 that should split to 4 slots.
My question unfolds in 2 parts:
<ol>
<li>Is it possible to do that splitting in more than 2 slots without going through the mess of cursors or solutions alike? I am guessing <em>WITH RECURSIVE</em> but there could be something smarter.
</li>
<li>How can I optimize this (particularly the search for the closest slot in <code>p3</code>) because the real case involves millions of rows?
</li>

When I join table 2 onto table 1 I get a lot of duplication because of the different dates.

The entries from table2 would look like this:

Essentially, this is going to be some form of (right) joining transactions and valuations. However, the catch here is that I would have to do one right join per (customer, item) combination. In other words, for every (customer, item) I would have to join the full set of timestamps.
My current (potentially pretty inefficient) solution loops across customers. For every customer, it creates the cumulative volume, right joins valuations and forward-fills (using the last function) columns coming from the transactions table:

This seems rather inefficient and becomes very slow for a large number of customers. Does anyone have an idea how to do that in one go? Would be great if you could help me out here.

445,70091842,MySQL FORCE INDEX got unexpected time cost,"Table:

MySQL version: <code>mysql:5.7.36.</code>
Here's the situation, in my project, the IP can match several hosts, I wanna get the result that matches (ip_a,host_a),(ip_b,host_b), so I use following sql:
<pre><code>select * from hosts h
     where (h.ip,h.host_name) in ((&quot;198.168.214.166&quot;,&quot;la-worker-01&quot;)... ...)
</code></pre>
Actually the target set is so large, around 3000 rows, this sql will scan the complete table, and it costs 24s, I tried to use <code>FORCE INDEX (unq_ip_host)</code>, but it still cost a lot of time, almost equals scanning the whole table. Explain result:
<code>type: range, key: unq_ip_host, key_len: 768,rows: 8952, filtered: 50.0, extra: Using where</code>
Then I tried to use <code>FORCE INDEX (idx_host)</code>, and this is the result of sql explain:
<code>type: ALL, key: null, key_len: null,rows: 284000, filtered: 50.0, extra: Using where</code>
<code>type</code> is <code>ALL</code> which means it won't use the index, this is weird, when I executed the sql, <code>FORCE INDEX (idx_host)</code> costs about 4.1s, but <code>FORCE INDEX (idx_ip_host)</code> costs 24s, this is weird.
<hr />
<pre><code>select count(distinct(ip)) from hosts; // result: 900000
select count(distinct(host_name)) from hosts; // result: 890000
</code></pre>
I can improve the sql but I'm puzzled as to why the two applications of <code>FORCE INDEX</code> provide different results.
Question:
<ol>
<li>Why doesn't MySQL use the index, when I use <code>FORCE INDEX (idx_host)</code>?</li>
<li>Why is scanning the entire table(<code>FORCE INDEX (idx_host)</code>) faster than using index(<code>FORCE INDEX (idx_ip_host)</code>)?</li>

I read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20618323/create-a-pivot-table-with-postgresql"">this post</a> about using <code>CASE STATEMENTS</code> in PG and have done the following:

Is there a performance difference between an INSERT statement vs. an INSERT... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE statement if the CONFLICT is never triggered?
I have a weekly bulk data load task where we COPY vendor data into a staging table, perform various exercises with it, and then merge it into our larger historical tables.

The process has now scaled to include much larger volumes of data and better partitioning by the vendor such that we rarely have any overlap between one week to the next.

This query takes forever (I haven't yet managed to see it completed).
But simply removing the <code>B.json_col</code> from <code>SELECT</code> makes the query super fast, so does using an <code>INNER JOIN</code> rather than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.
Given the characteristics of the tables, the quantity of data returned by each query should not be really different: only ~5% of rows from A should not have at least one corresponding B row, and the JSON field is relatively small (2 or 3 elements of 100 characters each).

485,70212945,Storing articles with separate chapters,"I'm in the process of building a simple blog-ish website, and I'm unsure about how to structure storage of articles/blogs in a database. I have a very simple editor, which separates input into individual chapters before submitting them, like (retrieved from php print_r):

Should I create a new table for storing chapters individually, or concatenate all chapters into one long string and store as a single TEXT field?
Imagined database structure would be something like:
<pre><code>TABLE posts:
id
title
chapters (references unique table with chapters for this specific entry)

TABLE chapters (unique identifier per post):
chapter_header
chapter_content
</code></pre>
vs. this, storing article as one long string
<pre><code>TABLE posts:
id
title
content (with html tags to separate titles and chapters)
</code></pre>
I imagine the first structure will make it easier to identify unique chapters, for styling purposes (without having to parse the input to add unique identifiers in the form of HTML classes or IDs). However, I'm not sure if creating a new table for each entry is &quot;correct procedure&quot; or considered bad practice.",mysql
